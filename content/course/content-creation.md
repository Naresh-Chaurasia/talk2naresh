## Java Selenium Automation

### Course Goals

Clarify your student's **ending point**. This will help you identify the skills youâ€™d like to help people acquire.

what **skills** do your students need to learn to reach their goal? what will be **different about your students** after they take your course?

Goals should be **realistic and measurable**, meaning students should be able to demonstrate their skill. Include strong action verbs ("build", "create", "explain", "differentiate"). If possible, avoid fuzzy words (like "understand", "know", "learn").

Example: At the end of my course, students will be able to brainstorm an idea for a novel from scratch, write a complete outline for their novel before starting to write, develop compelling character arcs, and confidently begin (or continue) writing their first novel.
