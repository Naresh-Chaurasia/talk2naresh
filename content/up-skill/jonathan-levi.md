limit your practice and studying to no more than 8 hours per week, to **prevent fatigue, burnout, and frustration**, and also to allow your brain the necessary time to adapt and build the new connections and habits we’re going to be studying

### Progressive Overload

**Progressive Overload**, progressive overload is a fundamental principle at the core of all strength and fitness training, and it’s applicable to your mental skills as well. The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress.

### Pomodoro technique

**Pomodoro technique**, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you’ll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you’ll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out
