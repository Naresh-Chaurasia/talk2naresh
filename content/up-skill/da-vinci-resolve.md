- [SQ3R System](#sq3r-system)

## SQ3R System

- [x] During the **survey** step, which we also call pre-reading, we skim or scan the content before we read it to prepare our mind for the new information. This is thoroughly covered in the coming lectures.
  - [x] Cut Page Project. A lot is covered in the project.
- [x] In the **question phase**, we ask ourselves questions to improve our motivation, such as why we’re trying to read and what’s in it for us. Clear motivation improves the reading process, and getting to the content from different perspectives improves our understanding.
  - [x] I can start with YouTube Channel, which is pending since for ever.
  - [x] I can create videos for online courses.
  - [x] It can help me with creating Podcast 
  - [x] It is  blocking lot of other things (Creating course on Udemy, Book writing, YouTube channel etc.)
- [ ] Next, we **read**. Either speed-reading, or in the normal fashion. When reading, you maximise the benefit of the previous S and Q steps, so you don’t have to reread, or dwell on irrelevant details. Then, we **recall**. We add details to the markers after reading each paragraph. This is our way to ensure we recall the paragraph. During our speed-reading training, we will have to read and recall a text several times until we get 100% retention. And only after several weeks will we really trust the brain to recall automatically. Finally, we **review**. We analyse the content from multiple perspectives, and we see what we learned and then we try to connect it to previous knowledge. The fastest readers, like Dr. Lev, will spend more time on this step than on all the previous steps taken together. That’s because if you do not review the article properly, it’s hard to understand it, and occasionally you will need to revisit it over and over. So, now that we understand the SQ3R Model, let’s learn how to optimise it starting out with surveying, or as we call it, pre-reading.
- [ ] **Technique number one** is to envision yourself using the material. As you read throughout the text, you should try to envision scenarios in which it could affect your life or how you could actually benefit from having that knowledge. How would you use the knowledge in your day-to-day life? Of course, as we mentioned before, try to connect any markers you develop to existing knowledge or experiences in your long-term memory.
- [ ] Technique **number two** , start asking questions. By developing your own questions and curiosities within the text, you’re going to see a huge improvement in both reading and comprehension. Perhaps for example, you see that the text mentions Baltimore, Maryland. Ask yourself, what the heck does Baltimore have to do with real estate law? What happened there? Was there maybe a precedent set? This trick alone is going to make you very motivated to read through the text and figure out, just what the heck is going on. Furthermore, you should find things that don’t seem to fit in and ask yourself, what they’re doing there.
- [ ] **Technique number three** , consider different perspectives. When I was struggling with pre-reading, Dr. Lev gave me a tip that has stuck with me to this day. He told me to ask myself questions involving perspectives, mine, the authors, even third parties. Though I’m not yet reading the text itself, I’m seeing the keywords and those keywords are enough to generate some pretty opinion laden questions. These include, what viewpoint do I anticipate the author taking? What viewpoint do I have going into reading this article? Where might the author be wrong? Where am I open to being persuaded on this topic? How could this material be improved? What would critics of this article likely say? Who are some people I know who might agree or disagree with what this article likely says? What would I expect to see in this text that I am not seeing at this speed?
