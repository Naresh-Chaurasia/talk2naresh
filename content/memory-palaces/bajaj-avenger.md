I use my avenger very often for most of small trips. It can server as a very good memory palace for my ToDo. I put an item, erase the items. Let me experiment and see how it all goes.

Most of the time it is not more than 10 items, so let me keep it simple.

#### Speedometer

#### Right Hand Mirror

#### Fuel Tank
