Work on the most important, highest return tasks first and moving away from working on things you really shouldn’t work on.

#### Introduction

If we implement time management practices and properly prioritize our work, we should see significant productivity gains. 

If we just manage our time, but haven’t prioritized what we need to do, we could find ourselves being very efficient working on the wrong things. If we have prioritized our tasks, but aren’t good at managing our time, we will know what we have to do, but be frustrated because we just aren’t getting to it. 

Working on the right things first instead of just working through your list. Actually getting the right things done.
