> Goal Setting Mastery Course - Himesh Trivedi

Since it is goal setting course, I need to look for actionable items that I can make use of for setting my goals.

This course is different from course on productivity, so don't try to draw parallels.

## Mont Vert Walking Track 2

#### **Fence Wall** - About your instructor

The Himesh Trivedi / Himesh Reshammiya is sitting on the **fence wall** and telling his story / singing songs

But in a nutshell, what I what I actually did was I prioritise three areas of my life. One was my **family**. One was my **job**. And most importantly, was my **part time business**. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in.

---

#### **Fence Railing** - compartmentalization technique

So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique

---

#### **Fence Pillar** - Where You Are

* Standing in pillar with telescope and watching how far is my goal
* 3rd and 4th is covered in MAAP

**firstly**, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you'll be surprised that the vast majority of people don't know where they are in life. They don't know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don't know what their purpose is. You may be one of them.

The **second aspect** is how you **plan** to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals.

The **third aspect** is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors.

And the **fourth aspect** is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game.

There is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. **Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get**. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.

#### **Green Bench** - MAAP Technique

* Sitting on bench and drawing a MAAP

The M stands for **mindset**, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.

The A stands for **awareness** awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.

The A stands for **action**, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.

And finally, the P, which stands for **Planning**, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?

---

#### **Park 2 Pillar** - Awareness

When I look at the Pillar, there is images of me looking back.

<img src="../awareness.png">

So awareness, as mentioned before, is knowing exactly what you want out of life. And not only that, knowing where you stand currently is also part of that awareness.

I don't mean anything materialistic, like a new car, a new house or any other materialistic things, I mean something that's deeper. And I need you to think long and hard about it. I want you to write. The first few things that actually popped into your mind, and that's where you write it in this section. So just take time out, pause this video and just do a little bit of brainstorming and what you actually want out of life.

Why do you want what you said you want?

---

#### **Park 2 Overhead Railing** - Mission Statement

So most organizations have this mission statement, which is basically a statement that best describes an organization's key purpose and value and what it is committed to doing.

Similarly, you yourself should have a mission statement that clearly describes what you feel like. Your purpose in life is it clearly separates what's important and what's not in your life. And it also describes your values.

---

#### **Park 1 Overhead Lamp** - SMART

**Specific**

An example of a broad term goal is a goal such as I would like more money in my life or I would like a promotion at work.

* I would like to earn ten thousand dollars more this year than last year.
* I would like to be promoted to the position of general manager.

The M stands for **measurable**, your goals should have some form of monitoring or tracking. So in other words, you should be able to know how far you are away from achieving your goals, whether you're on track and ultimately finding out when you have finally achieved your goals.

The A stands for **achievable**. So, in other words, how **realistic** are your goals? Are you able to accomplish it based on your current constraints, such as financial factors or time constraints or resource constraints? Also, **is this the right time for you**? So, for example, I will go back to the example of wanting a promotion at work. You may you may need to step back and ask yourself questions such as do you have the right qualifications or experience to suit that role? If you don't, then maybe setting another goal, such as developing the experience and qualifications necessary to get that promotion before you actually set the goal of getting a promotion.

Also to highlight the example of, for example, wanting more money, you may need to step back and ask yourself, how will you get more money? You won't get more money by doing the same thing that you're doing now. So you may need to re-evaluate your goal and change it to having a goal of developing, for example, a second stream of income. That would be a goal prior to having more money.

**The R stands for relevant**, this means that the goal that you have sent have said should be worthwhile and full of meaning to you. Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, if you would like a promotion at work and your overall goal is to be financially free, then is it worth gaining that extra qualification that you need for gaining that experience? Or should you utilize your time in developing another stream of income? Those are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself.

The T stands for **time based**, you need to set a date or some sort of timeline to achieve your goal. It is absolutely critical to assign this date, this deadline date, as mentally you are now under a deadline to achieve that goal.

---

#### **Garden 1 Drainage Pipeline**

If I don't take care of my goals, they will go down the **Drainage**

* adventure goals
* family goals / relationship goals
* financial goals
* health goals
  
the next stage is to determine which goals are short term, medium term or long term. It's time to be realistic at this stage, not all goals can be short term

---

#### **Penguin Dustbin** - Choose at least five

The first step in this is to choose at least five to seven short term goals that you feel are priority for each category. Now, the amount of goals that you choose is entirely up to you. You can choose less or more. The important thing here is that it should be comfortable for you and not too overwhelming and at the same time, not too less.

The question here is, how relevant is your goal to your overall mission statement? Is it worthwhile? And is this what you really want in life? And time bound now.

make it more smarter, the more smarter your goals, the more specific, the more measurable, the more achievable, the more relevant. And the more time bound they are, the higher your chance of actually achieving your goals

---

#### **Trees / Forest** - Time

And when I do this exercise, it brings into perspective that, yes, they do have time. It's just how that time is managed and how you how you spend that time

#### **Bench Green Red** - Compound Effect

So another example is simply reading, for example, 10 pages of a good book every day will equate to reading approximately 10 to 15 books a year

Then the key to becoming good at them is to know more than what 95 percent of the population know. And the best way to do this is to read books on that particular topic. So, again, if you read an average of 10 to 15 books on a particular topic, then you automatically become an expert in that field. So that's just food for thought. The reason I'm saying this is that every action that you take towards your goals, no matter how small or trivial they seem, will eventually add up to a bigger result, provided that you remain consistent and determined and that the action is in the right direction


---

#### **Speed Breaker** - compartmentalization technique

But for now, just think of which colors that you want to assign to each of your goal categories

---

#### **Gas Pipeline** - Belief Systems

So belief systems, a simple definition of a belief system is that it is a set of habits which ultimately control an individual's behavior or actions, both consciously and unconsciously, towards a given task or as a reaction to a given situation

So just to refer to the belief system work worksheet. I want you to make a list of your belief systems around the different gold categories once you have made the list of those beliefs, I want you to analyze whether that belief system is in line with your goals

your beliefs create your emotions, your emotions, create your actions and your actions ultimately control your outcome
