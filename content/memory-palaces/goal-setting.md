> Goal Setting Mastery Course - Himesh Trivedi

Since it is goal setting course, I need to look for actionable items that I can make use of for setting my goals.

This course is different from course on productivity, so don't try to draw parallels.

## Mont Vert Walking Track 2

#### **Fence Wall** - About your instructor

The Himesh Trivedi / Himesh Reshammiya is sitting on the **fence wall** and telling his story / singing songs

But in a nutshell, what I what I actually did was I prioritise three areas of my life. One was my **family**. One was my **job**. And most importantly, was my **part time business**. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in.

#### **Fence Railing** - compartmentalization technique

So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique

#### **Fence Pillar** - Where You Are

* Standing in pillar with telescope and watching how far is my goal.

**firstly**, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you'll be surprised that the vast majority of people don't know where they are in life. They don't know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don't know what their purpose is. You may be one of them.

The **second aspect** is how you plan to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals.

The **third aspect** is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors.

And the **fourth aspect** is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game.

There is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. **Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get**. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.

#### **Green Bench** - MAAP Technique

* Sitting on bench and drawing a MAAP

The M stands for **mindset**, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.

The A stands for **awareness** awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.

The A stands for **action**, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.

And finally, the P, which stands for **Planning**, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?
