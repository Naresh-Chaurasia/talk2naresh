#### Kozomba on Fire

**Taraxa V/s Kizomba**

So taraxa is slow movements the wave movements that lady moving the hips. And when you are very slowly  dancing with your lady or with your partner because the music is smooth there are not many strong beats.

**Wave - 1 Movement Taraxa**

I will be like these feet apart. Relax. One man one hand on the belly another on the back. So you can really feel the wave. And let's do this. This is the easy easiest way to learn to wave first.

* Let's go down a little bit
* Then back with Hip
* Then Up
* Then to the front with hip

**Wave - 1 Movement Taraxa weight on right leg**

**Wave - 1 Movement Taraxa weight on left leg**

Knees go out.
