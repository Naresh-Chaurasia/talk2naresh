<p>Goal Setting Mastery Course - Himesh Trivedi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it is goal setting course, I need to look for actionable items that I can make use of for setting my goals.</p>
<p>This course is different from course on productivity, so don&rsquo;t try to draw parallels.</p>
<h2 id="mont-vert-walking-track-2">Mont Vert Walking Track 2</h2>
<h4 id="fence-wall---about-your-instructor"><strong>Fence Wall</strong> - About your instructor</h4>
<p>The Himesh Trivedi / Himesh Reshammiya is sitting on the <strong>fence wall</strong> and telling his story / singing songs</p>
<p>But in a nutshell, what I what I actually did was I prioritise three areas of my life. One was my <strong>family</strong>. One was my <strong>job</strong>. And most importantly, was my <strong>part time business</strong>. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="fence-railing---compartmentalization-technique"><strong>Fence Railing</strong> - compartmentalization technique</h4>
<p>So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="fence-pillar---where-you-are"><strong>Fence Pillar</strong> - Where You Are</h4>
<ul>
<li>Standing in pillar with telescope and watching how far is my goal</li>
<li>3rd and 4th is covered in MAAP</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>firstly</strong>, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you&rsquo;ll be surprised that the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t know where they are in life. They don&rsquo;t know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don&rsquo;t know what their purpose is. You may be one of them.</p>
<p>The <strong>second aspect</strong> is how you <strong>plan</strong> to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals.</p>
<p>The <strong>third aspect</strong> is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors.</p>
<p>And the <strong>fourth aspect</strong> is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game.</p>
<p>There is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. <strong>Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get</strong>. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="green-bench---maap-technique"><strong>Green Bench</strong> - MAAP Technique</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sitting on bench and drawing a MAAP</li>
</ul>
<p>The M stands for <strong>mindset</strong>, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.</p>
<p>The A stands for <strong>awareness</strong> awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.</p>
<p>The A stands for <strong>action</strong>, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.</p>
<p>And finally, the P, which stands for <strong>Planning</strong>, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="park-2-pillar---awareness"><strong>Park 2 Pillar</strong> - Awareness</h4>
<p>When I look at the Pillar, there is images of me looking back.</p>
<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/goal-setting/../awareness.png">
<p>So awareness, as mentioned before, is knowing exactly what you want out of life. And not only that, knowing where you stand currently is also part of that awareness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean anything materialistic, like a new car, a new house or any other materialistic things, I mean something that&rsquo;s deeper. And I need you to think long and hard about it. I want you to write. The first few things that actually popped into your mind, and that&rsquo;s where you write it in this section. So just take time out, pause this video and just do a little bit of brainstorming and what you actually want out of life.</p>
<p>Why do you want what you said you want?</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="park-2-overhead-railing---mission-statement"><strong>Park 2 Overhead Railing</strong> - Mission Statement</h4>
<p>So most organizations have this mission statement, which is basically a statement that best describes an organization&rsquo;s key purpose and value and what it is committed to doing.</p>
<p>Similarly, you yourself should have a mission statement that clearly describes what you feel like. Your purpose in life is it clearly separates what&rsquo;s important and what&rsquo;s not in your life. And it also describes your values.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="park-1-overhead-lamp---smart"><strong>Park 1 Overhead Lamp</strong> - SMART</h4>
<p><strong>Specific</strong></p>
<p>An example of a broad term goal is a goal such as I would like more money in my life or I would like a promotion at work.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to earn ten thousand dollars more this year than last year.</li>
<li>I would like to be promoted to the position of general manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>The M stands for <strong>measurable</strong>, your goals should have some form of monitoring or tracking. So in other words, you should be able to know how far you are away from achieving your goals, whether you&rsquo;re on track and ultimately finding out when you have finally achieved your goals.</p>
<p>The A stands for <strong>achievable</strong>. So, in other words, how <strong>realistic</strong> are your goals? Are you able to accomplish it based on your current constraints, such as financial factors or time constraints or resource constraints? Also, <strong>is this the right time for you</strong>? So, for example, I will go back to the example of wanting a promotion at work. You may you may need to step back and ask yourself questions such as do you have the right qualifications or experience to suit that role? If you don&rsquo;t, then maybe setting another goal, such as developing the experience and qualifications necessary to get that promotion before you actually set the goal of getting a promotion.</p>
<p>Also to highlight the example of, for example, wanting more money, you may need to step back and ask yourself, how will you get more money? You won&rsquo;t get more money by doing the same thing that you&rsquo;re doing now. So you may need to re-evaluate your goal and change it to having a goal of developing, for example, a second stream of income. That would be a goal prior to having more money.</p>
<p><strong>The R stands for relevant</strong>, this means that the goal that you have sent have said should be worthwhile and full of meaning to you. Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, if you would like a promotion at work and your overall goal is to be financially free, then is it worth gaining that extra qualification that you need for gaining that experience? Or should you utilize your time in developing another stream of income? Those are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself.</p>
<p>The T stands for <strong>time based</strong>, you need to set a date or some sort of timeline to achieve your goal. It is absolutely critical to assign this date, this deadline date, as mentally you are now under a deadline to achieve that goal.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="garden-1-drainage-pipeline"><strong>Garden 1 Drainage Pipeline</strong></h4>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t take care of my goals, they will go down the <strong>Drainage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>adventure goals</li>
<li>family goals / relationship goals</li>
<li>financial goals</li>
<li>health goals</li>
</ul>
<p>the next stage is to determine which goals are short term, medium term or long term. It&rsquo;s time to be realistic at this stage, not all goals can be short term</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="penguin-dustbin---choose-at-least-five"><strong>Penguin Dustbin</strong> - Choose at least five</h4>
<p>The first step in this is to choose at least five to seven short term goals that you feel are priority for each category. Now, the amount of goals that you choose is entirely up to you. You can choose less or more. The important thing here is that it should be comfortable for you and not too overwhelming and at the same time, not too less.</p>
<p>The question here is, how relevant is your goal to your overall mission statement? Is it worthwhile? And is this what you really want in life? And time bound now.</p>
<p>make it more smarter, the more smarter your goals, the more specific, the more measurable, the more achievable, the more relevant. And the more time bound they are, the higher your chance of actually achieving your goals</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="trees--forest---time"><strong>Trees / Forest</strong> - Time</h4>
<p>And when I do this exercise, it brings into perspective that, yes, they do have time. It&rsquo;s just how that time is managed and how you how you spend that time</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="bench-green-red---compound-effect"><strong>Bench Green Red</strong> - Compound Effect</h4>
<p>So another example is simply reading, for example, 10 pages of a good book every day will equate to reading approximately 10 to 15 books a year</p>
<p>Then the key to becoming good at them is to know more than what 95 percent of the population know. And the best way to do this is to read books on that particular topic. So, again, if you read an average of 10 to 15 books on a particular topic, then you automatically become an expert in that field. So that&rsquo;s just food for thought. The reason I&rsquo;m saying this is that every action that you take towards your goals, no matter how small or trivial they seem, will eventually add up to a bigger result, provided that you remain consistent and determined and that the action is in the right direction</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="speed-breaker---compartmentalization-technique"><strong>Speed Breaker</strong> - compartmentalization technique</h4>
<p>But for now, just think of which colors that you want to assign to each of your goal categories</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="gas-pipeline---belief-systems"><strong>Gas Pipeline</strong> - Belief Systems</h4>
<p>So belief systems, a simple definition of a belief system is that it is a set of habits which ultimately control an individual&rsquo;s behavior or actions, both consciously and unconsciously, towards a given task or as a reaction to a given situation</p>
<p>So just to refer to the belief system work worksheet. I want you to make a list of your belief systems around the different gold categories once you have made the list of those beliefs, I want you to analyze whether that belief system is in line with your goals</p>
<p>your beliefs create your emotions, your emotions, create your actions and your actions ultimately control your outcome</p>

<p>Speed Reading by Jonathan Levi !</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the life changing course that I have ever done. I have to come back to this as often as possible. Make it part of my life and you will live your dreams. Go on Naresh, its time to live your dreams!!!
I am keeping some location in Memory Palace unused, if need later for some information.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we&rsquo;re going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programmes out there. It&rsquo;s a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we&rsquo;re going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I&rsquo;m trying to say is this. You&rsquo;re going to have to work for this, and it&rsquo;s not going to happen overnight. But, with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we&rsquo;ve provided, you can and you will succeed.</p>
<p>So we want you to limit your practice and studying to no more than 8 hours per week, to prevent fatigue, burnout, and frustration, and also to allow your brain the necessary time to adapt and build the new connections and habits we’re going to be studying</p>
<h3 id="main-door-front---progressive-overload"><strong>Main Door Front</strong> - Progressive Overload</h3>
<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/jonathan-levi/../progressive-overload.png">
<p>Throughout the course, we&rsquo;re going to be using a training methodology called progressive overload, progressive overload is a fundamental principle at the core of all strength and fitness training, and it&rsquo;s applicable to your mental skills as well. The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. <strong>You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough</strong>. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="main-door-peep-hole---pomodoro-technique"><strong>Main Door Peep Hole</strong> - Pomodoro technique</h3>
<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/jonathan-levi/../pomodoro2.png">
<p>Pomodoro technique, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you&rsquo;ll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you&rsquo;ll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out</p>

<h3 id="main-door-back---memory"><strong>Main Door Back</strong> - Memory</h3>
<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/jonathan-levi/../memory.gif">
<p>Our brains do use several different types of buffers to work with the various types of information. This basically means that words, ideas, images, and scenes, they don&rsquo;t all use the same path to get to the short term memory.</p>

<p>Well, once you&rsquo;ve used your <strong>working memory</strong> to process, understand, and interact with a piece of information, your <strong>short term memory</strong> is what keeps it in your mind for about 15 to 20 seconds. This might seem like a really short amount of time, and it is, that&rsquo;s why for the majority of the course, we&rsquo;re going to focus on improving the connexion all the way from your working memory to your long term memory. This is because if you do a good enough job creating those short term memories that&rsquo;ll stick till you get to the end of a page or an article, you&rsquo;ll only need to use some simple review techniques and regular maintenance to keep things in your long term memory, where we eventually want all our new information to remain.</p>
<p>This means that right now, our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks. Without the right infrastructure and base skillset to improve these two types of memory, speed reading is pretty useless, even impossible</p>

<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/jonathan-levi/../neural-network.jpg">
<p>But basically memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time. This strengthens the connexion between those two neurons and presto, you have a new memory. This is an important point to make because it shows that the creation of memories requires connexion between two neurons or a connexion to existing neurons in your brain. The other thing you need to know is that when this happens over and over again the cluster of neurons and their synaptic connexions become something called a neural network. From artificial intelligence research we know that neurons work better in these types of clusters. This means that when several neurons fire together the signal is actually amplified. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so crucial to store memories in several connected neurons and to further connect them to the memories that we often use.</p>
<p>Because there are so many connexions and stories and experiences around that piece of information your brain determines that it&rsquo;s critical and will never erode it away. Knowing this can benefit us tremendously. The process of super learning necessitates that we create more connexions to the information we want to learn</p>

<h3 id="wall---neuroplasticity"><strong>Wall</strong> - neuroplasticity</h3>
<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/jonathan-levi/../neuroplasticity.jpg">
<p>Well first and foremost I want to dispel the myth that children&rsquo;s brains are somehow better at absorbing new information or that they have a higher neuroplasticity.</p>
<p>Recent studies have actually shown that this is simply not true. The reason that children seem to learn with more ease is that they&rsquo;re learning literally every waking hour and all information is new and exciting information for them. Furthermore, research shows that our brains do play by the use it or lose it rule. Most adults lose the ability to learn rapidly simply because they settle into their day-job and they stop learning in the volume that they used to as children, not because their brain chemistry or #neuroplasticity# have actually changed</p>

<p>So, as you go along throughout the rest of the course, I want you to remember that the games are important, but that the real test of your super-learner skills is whether or not you can memorise everyday information, speed-read your daily reading assignments, and learn actual skills faster</p>

<h3 id="wall-switch-board-on-left---chunking"><strong>Wall Switch Board on left</strong> - Chunking</h3>
<img src="/talk2naresh/memory-palaces/jonathan-levi/../chunking.png">
<p><strong>Chunking</strong> - psychological phenomenon</p>
<p>The chunking system is very good because it&rsquo;s an entry level mnemonic technique. It&rsquo;s not only much faster and easier to learn and play with than some of the heavier visual memory techniques we&rsquo;re going to learn later, but it&rsquo;s also a critical element of the overall technique. This is to say that even after we teach you the methods to remember things way more easily, <strong>you&rsquo;re still going to be chunking details or memories into groups of three or four so that they can better comply with the requirements of your short term memory</strong>. Sure, we could train your short term memory to hold a larger number of items, but that would only slow you down and place a larger cognitive load on you. At three to five items there is no slow down so it&rsquo;s preferable to work in this range. Furthermore, by chunking groups of items into one entity, we can stack five chunks of five objects each into our working memory and effectively store 25 items in our short term or working memory without any cognitive overload. Because of this massive advantage, you&rsquo;ll notice that all of the world&rsquo;s top memory athletes use systems that are based on chunking combined with powerful visual and spatial memory techniques that we&rsquo;ll be learning later on in the course. The other nice thing about chunking is that it works with just about everything. Take a sequence of numbers or a couple pieces of information. For example, brown dog, tall fence, lost Frisbee. You can even try to chunk information about people into neat little bundles. It might seem strange, but remembering that information in chunks is actually much easier than if it were to be put all together</p>

<p>Dual Coding. Remember how we learned that the brain has different buffers for working memory depending on the type of information it&rsquo;s interacting with?</p>
<p>A great example of this, by the way, would be to try and explain to some of your friends what you learned in the last few lectures about your memory and about chunking. By teaching this information, you force your brain to look at it from a different angle, to deconstruct it, to form it into your own words, and then to present it in a compelling way. As they say, something once taught is something twice learned, and we would absolutely love to see you get out there and share what you&rsquo;ve learned with your friends so far</p>

<h3 id="samsung-1114-subwoofer---visual-memory--marker"><strong>Samsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer</strong> - Visual Memory &amp; Marker</h3>
<p>Well, it means that we can not only spot an approaching predator very quickly, we can also remember visual information, or pictures, far faster and with more clarity than we can remember things like spoken words</p>
<p>It also has to do with the fact that pictures are more heavily encoded and they speak to different types of working memory buffers, as we mentioned before. Pictures are imbued with rich and detailed information, such as colour, context, shape, and size, and they&rsquo;re more likely to have a higher number of neural connexions, as they convey emotion and depth, interaction, and so much more. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Visual information is also alarmingly fast. Research has demonstrated that we can comprehend the contents of an image in just a fraction of a second</p>
<p>This little demonstration shows us just how effective it is to see things as pictures and symbols rather than auditory information. For this reason, in addition to all the other steps we have to take to prime our memory, it&rsquo;s best that we also learn to transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures, or what we call markers, as soon as we possibly can. It won&rsquo;t surprise you to learn, additionally, that the best and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre, or emotionally connected to memories. After all, adult learners need to connect information to pre-existing knowledge, and as always, our hippocampi are busy working away to determine what stuff matters and what stuff doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>She explained to me that she struggled a great deal with this first memorization assignment. This is because they were simply looking at the bones in a diagram, a very undetailed image in a textbook without any emotional connexion or experiential component to it</p>
<p>However, the detailed, experiential images, the emotionally significant experience of interacting with a dead body, and the very concrete, minute details are what allowed her to memorise the ligaments much better than the bones</p>
<p>Ultimately, you have to learn to go with what images come naturally for you. Try to lean towards whatever type of image you find most conductive for you to remember, but just make sure that, number one, there&rsquo;s as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also probably develop fixed markers for subjects that you spend a lot of time reading about.</p>
<p>With time, you too will build up a visual library like this one, which will make calling up images much faster and make it much easier to link together strings of images to form complex concepts that easily convert into long term memory.</p>

<h3 id="samsung-1114-subwoofer-table---visual-memory--reading"><strong>Samsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer Table</strong> - Visual Memory &amp; Reading</h3>
<p>How Do We Apply Visual Memory To Reading</p>
<p>One of those future lectures will come up when we get to speed reading, and it&rsquo;ll explain in detail how you&rsquo;ll use regular intervals of pauses during your reading. This is not just because speed reading is very exhausting for the eyes and for the brain, but also because these <strong>pauses allow us to optimise the process of learning</strong></p>
<p>You see, just like there are at least three types of memory, there are also three stages, or processes, of memory. They are, <strong>encoding, storage, and retrieval</strong>. Where most people get into trouble is that they try to do all three at once. Have you ever read a paragraph or a page of text only to realise that you&rsquo;ve been deeply immersed in thought and you haven&rsquo;t actually paid attention to anything that you just read? This is what happens when you&rsquo;re trying to do all three memory processes at once. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;ve ever studied process operations management or economics, you know that <strong>grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimise waste</strong>. I mean, you don&rsquo;t wash one shirt at a time and then put it in the dryer all by itself. You wash all of your clothes together, put them all in the dryer together, and then fold them when they&rsquo;re all done, right? With reading, you&rsquo;ve been doing it one shirt at a time, trying to multitask the washing and drying and folding for each shirt. It&rsquo;s just as inefficient as it sounds, and so we&rsquo;re going to separate it out into three separate processes to reduce cognitive strain and improve overall efficiency</p>
<p>Now I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, how exactly do we do that? Well, because of the limitations on your short term memory and the inherent difficulty in multitasking visualisation with reading, we&rsquo;ll be learning how to make short pauses of about one to two seconds after each page, or even take micro pauses of just fractions of a second after reading information-dense paragraphs. You&rsquo;ll also take longer pauses every 10 minutes or less to review what you&rsquo;ve already hopefully put into the beginning stages of long term memory. As we&rsquo;re going to discover, <strong>when we learn about space repetition software, you brain needs to periodically repeat and review information in increasingly long intervals in order to remember it and prove to the hippocampi that it&rsquo;s relevant and worth remembering</strong>. This is similar to the idea that you must continue weight training to improve your strength and increase muscle mass. If your brain, like your body, thinks that the information you&rsquo;re using is a one off occurrence, it won&rsquo;t waste the time investing the resources to remember it.</p>
<p>In short, this is why we take small pauses after each page and much longer pauses of 15 to 30 seconds after each chapter, to play back and retrieve our stored markers and perform a form of spaced repetition to improve our long term retention. This also means that it&rsquo;s not a bad idea to spend a few minutes a week reviewing markers and ideas from books you&rsquo;ve read months or even years before, if you really wish to remember them</p>
<p>While we&rsquo;re discussing images and visual markers, it&rsquo;s worth noting that not all markers have to be visual. In fact, smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision. Of course, we can&rsquo;t understand an entire book using our sense of smell alone, and so we&rsquo;re focusing on images, but if you read about, say, chocolate, and you can conjure up the smell or the taste of chocolate, that&rsquo;s actually a great marker for remembering that data point. And if it works for you, even better. Whatever types of markers we use, whether they&rsquo;re visual or sensory or some other types that we have yet to learn about, it&rsquo;ll almost certainly be a mix in the end. This mix of markers, when retrieved and reviewed, reminds us of the details that we&rsquo;ve decided we need to remember. And when combined with our existing knowledge and opinions and ideas about the content, it allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory very quickly and very effectively</p>
<p>So, instead of reading back over the chapter, we can retrieve all of the markers we&rsquo;ve created and start thinking about how they&rsquo;re connected together logically. We play them back almost like a film strip in our minds, and that helps our retrieval</p>

<h4 id="ramp---fear"><strong>Ramp</strong> - <strong>Fear</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Fear</strong> and Our Brain&rsquo;s Default Setting</p>
<p>If I had to pick the number one <strong>silent killer of our productivity</strong> and the biggest thing that <strong>holds people back</strong> from being as productive as they can possibly be, that would be your own brain and its desire to keep you safe.</p>
<p>Now, all of us struggle with <strong>procrastination</strong> from time to time. In fact, in many cases, our procrastination is simply a symptom of fear, whether it be <strong>fear of</strong> failure, being concerned we won’t live up to expectations or produce good enough work, or even if it’s just a task that’s outside of our <strong>comfort zone</strong>, we’ll rationalize reason after reason.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just physical harm that your brain is trying to protect you from. It&rsquo;s also <strong>emotional harm</strong>.</p>
<p>But because our brain doesn&rsquo;t <strong>distinguish</strong> the difference between physical or emotional harm, it wants to avoid both.</p>
<p>Courage is not the absence of fear. It&rsquo;s the willingness to act in spite of fear.</p>

<h4 id="seating-arc---overwhelm"><strong>Seating Arc</strong> - <strong>Overwhelm</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Overwhelm</strong> - How it holds you back and how you can beat it</p>
<p>Now, here’s the thing. When your brain gets overwhelmed, it’s kind of like a breaker being shut off. Your brain just completely shuts down. Now, I hear this from my clients and my students all the time. They’re overwhelmed and they don’t even know where to start. And in many cases, when this happens, they freeze, it paralyzes them and they’re just stuck in the mud. But the problem is those tasks don’t go away. That only makes the problem worse. I do have some good news for you. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. You see, overwhelm really is subjective. <strong>It’s much more of an emotion that it is a reality</strong>. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way. Please don’t leave this lecture without really internalizing this fact. <strong>With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way</strong>.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ve got to do when you get overwhelmed is to get all those thoughts out of your head.</p>
<p>And once you’ve got it on paper, you can then start to organize it and create a plan</p>

<h4 id="soilearth---plan"><strong>Soil/Earth</strong> - <strong>Plan</strong></h4>
<p>Failing To Plan</p>
<p>The first thing that planning is going to do for you is provide clarity now, <strong>planning forces you to get clear on what it is you actually want to accomplish</strong>. It allows you to really decide how to invest your time and what your most important tasks are. Now, as silly as this sounds, many don’t even know. And it sounds simple, I know, but I can’t tell you how often when I sit down to write out the three most important tasks that I want to accomplish that day, how frequently I pause and have to really give it some serious thought. This is a really critical first step. Another key benefit of having a plan is the locks you in. And once you lock in to your priorities of the day, it’s really going to help you lock out all the distractions and all the things that pop up along the way. They can get you sidetracked. And lastly, a plan creates great subconscious accountability. When you’ve got a system and you’ve got a plan and you actually write out what your top priorities are for the day, I’m telling you, it will nag at you until you get it done. And I’ve found that this will at least double your chance of actually completing that task if you commit to it in writing. Please don’t underestimate the power behind this particular advantage, because be honest, we all love Crosson. Those things off our To-Do list. Now, if you don’t consistently plan your week and plan your day and you’re not doing that already, <strong>your job is to start planning your day and planning your week before the end of this course</strong>, I’m going to get into more depth and walk through this in more detail in future lectures. But like Benjamin Franklin said, failure to plan is planning to fail.</p>

<p>Waiting for Things to Be <strong>Perfect</strong></p>
<p>Our next silent killer of productivity is waiting for things to be perfect, you see, unproductive people are great at waiting for the time to be right. They&rsquo;re great at waiting until they feel like it, waiting until they&rsquo;re in the mood to get started. <strong>The door of opportunity is right there for them to walk through it, but they&rsquo;re waiting for it to open now. Rarely does the perfect time ever come</strong>. So let&rsquo;s take a look at our rocket right here. Now, with the rocket such as this one, <strong>there&rsquo;s something called escape velocity</strong>. Now, a rocket must reach a speed of about seven miles per second to escape the earth&rsquo;s pull of gravity. But almost all of that energy is needed at the beginning when a rocket first launches. You and I are no different. But the good news is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion and <strong>all you need to do to get started is to get started and the rest will usually take care of itself</strong>.</p>

<p>The Myth of <strong>Multi-Tasking</strong></p>
<p>So this next silent killer of productivity might surprise you is multitasking</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only able to actually focus deeply on one task at a time. In fact, according to one researcher, instead of making you more productive, multitasking can actually double the amount of time it takes you to complete a specific task while also potentially doubling your mistakes. That&rsquo;s a pretty significant mental cost. And to make matters worse, when you get distracted. It takes you almost 15 minutes on average to get fully back in the flow</p>
<p>ou&rsquo;ve got to turn that phone off, shut off your email alerts and put everything else aside. And just by focusing on your most important task, first, by blocking off that time, specifically where all you focus on is that critical task, you&rsquo;ll see huge results</p>

<p>Your brain and your body does need time to rejuvenate and needs breaks in order to perform this optimal level. But these types of activities, surfing the web, checking your email, looking at your Facebook page, these are fake breaks.

<p>Amy Cuddy is a social psychologist and professor at Harvard Business School, delivered a great TED talk that shows the power of influence we have on ourselves and specifically regarding the way that we use our own body. In her studies, she put participants into <strong>high powered poses or low power poses</strong> for just two minutes now. You&rsquo;ll see over here on the left, we&rsquo;ve got our high power poses. This one right here has been dubbed the Wonder Woman Pose. But in each one of these scenarios, you&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re making their body wide and or expanding their stance, and over here on the right hand side, you&rsquo;re going to see low power poses. They&rsquo;re making themselves small or closing their body language. And after just two minutes, they test the participants hormone levels to see if it had any effect. And quite frankly, I found the findings astounding. Now, those who struck the high power pose, so a 20 percent increase in testosterone and a 25 percent decrease in cortisol, cortisol being a hormone most times associated with stress and those that spent two minutes in the low power poses saw a 10 percent decrease in testosterone and a 15 percent increase in cortisol</p>

<p>L Shape - <strong>Time</strong> Managment V/s Self Management (Small L V/s Big L).</p>
<p>And whether we like it or not, each minute is only made up 60 seconds and each week one hundred and sixty eight hours. And those are going to pass us by at the same speed no matter what we do. <strong>And in reality, when we&rsquo;re talking about time management, what we really should be talking about is self-management</strong>, because the one and only thing that we have one hundred percent total control over is what we do and how we manage that time. Now, my suggestion is don&rsquo;t wish you had more time. <strong>Instead, wish you had better self-management, better systems, better tactics, better habits, and probably most importantly, better execution on the stuff that you already know how to do and actually put it in a play which you already know you should be doing but aren&rsquo;t doing</strong>. These are the things that really make a difference. And these are the things that you have. One hundred percent total control over time. If you don&rsquo;t know how to manage yourself, if you don&rsquo;t know how to set up and actually consistently use the right systems, it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if you could make more time up here. You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fully take advantage of that extra time. So I&rsquo;m going to encourage you right from the start to instill a new belief. And it&rsquo;s not about time management. It&rsquo;s about self management and making the most of the time that you already have. Because if you do make the most of that time that you already do have, you&rsquo;re going to double and triple the results that you&rsquo;re getting now.</p>

<h4 id="overhead-park-fencing--railing---spending-time"><strong>Overhead Park Fencing / Railing</strong> - Spending <strong>Time</strong></h4>
<p>Spending <strong>Time</strong> vs Investing Time. A big clock hanging, and time is ticking.</p>
<p>Now, one of the biggest mistakes, I think unhappy, broke and unsuccessful people make is in thinking <strong>short term versus long term</strong> when making decisions.</p>
<p>And most people, myself included in the past, is typically focused on how they&rsquo;re <strong>spending their time each day instead of focusing on how they&rsquo;re investing their time</strong></p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a huge difference now when most people think of time management productivity, it&rsquo;s in regards to getting the maximum number of things done in a day, a week or a year. But I&rsquo;m going to encourage you to look at it from another perspective. <strong>When you invest in something, you hope that will give you a return that&rsquo;s greater than what you invested</strong>. For example, if you put five dollars into a stock, you hope to get much more than that, five dollars over time. And I encourage you to look at time the exact same way. Spending your time is about getting things done, <strong>investing your time is about setting up systems and delegating tasks that will literally save you hours and create new hours in the future</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, <strong>many people won&rsquo;t take the time to train someone else to do that task or automate that task because it usually requires more effort in the short run</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the people that I speak with, <strong>a lot of them have trouble delegating and letting go</strong>. <strong>But once you understand the difference between spending your time and getting more time back in the future by investing your time, it becomes a real game changer</strong>.</p>
<p>So focus more on time investing activities that will pay you back each and every single day and are going to make you more and more productive.</p>

<p>The Importance of <strong>Sleep</strong> to Your Productivity</p>
<p>According to the University of Pennsylvania, if you get six hours of sleep per night for two weeks straight, which is a little less probably than you need, your mental and physical performance declines at the same level as if you stayed awake for 48 hours straight.</p>
<p>Another solution can be to take what I call a power nap. And most sleep research will suggest to keep it to less than 30 minutes to keep it from interfering with your normal sleep schedules and circadian rhythms. Even something as small as a 20 minute nap has been proven to improve your memory</p>

<h4 id="gas-bank-door---water"><strong>Gas Bank Door</strong> - <strong>Water</strong></h4>
<p>The Healthiest Energy Drink That Most of Us Have Access to For Free!</p>
<p>When your brain is fully hydrated, you think faster, you&rsquo;re more focused, you have more creativity and more clarity. But most importantly, you&rsquo;d be more productive. While your brain only makes up about three percent of your body mass, it actually uses up to 20 percent of the water and nutrients that you take in. And just like with sleep deprivation that we just got done talking about, even small amounts of dehydration can lead to big effects. Just one percent of dehydration can lead to a five percent cognitive decline</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sleep deprived and you don&rsquo;t have as much energy as normal usually is because of dehydration. Start with water and nine times out of ten, that&rsquo;s going to solve the problem. So I&rsquo;m going to encourage you to drink water early, drink water often and stay hydrated. You&rsquo;ll notice the difference and I promise you&rsquo;ll thank me later</p>

<p>Mastering Your Energy, Mood &amp; Emotional State</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve got two choices. <strong>You can direct your attention to those things that are going well, things that are great in your life, things that are where you want them to be, and things that are within your control</strong>. And when you do that, how do you feel? You might feel a sense of gratitude, hope, appreciation and progress. But what if you instead choose to focus on what&rsquo;s missing in your life, what&rsquo;s going wrong, and focusing on all the things that maybe you&rsquo;re going wrong in that are missing, that you can&rsquo;t even control in that instance, how do you feel</p>
<p>The tough part is that most of our thoughts and behaviors are habits, the things that we do and thoughts that we think over and over again without even really giving it any conscious thought. So over time, you&rsquo;ve developed automatic patterns and you habitually lean towards thinking one way or the other</p>
<p>Another major contributor to your mood is how you&rsquo;re using your body at any given moment. As I mentioned in that earlier lecture, studies have shown that something as simple as how you use your body posture and have a hormonal effect specifically as it relates to testosterone and cortisol</p>

Now, most people love to put their focus on the latest and greatest thing, the new idea, the sexy idea. But those that execute the fundamentals actually get the best results</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard the term knowledge is power, but I disagree. I don&rsquo;t think knowledge really is power. I truly believe that knowledge is potential power, potential power, but only power, if actually acted upon and used that real power comes from its application or execution because without action, there&rsquo;s no results</p>

<h4 id="basketball-board---the-warren-buffet-productivity-secret"><strong>Basketball Board</strong> - The Warren Buffet Productivity Secret</h4>
<p>I think one of the best ways to get better results is to model with the ultra successful people do sustain success is never one hundred percent luck. That just happens to people. Those who are really successful always leave a trail of clues. They simply approach things differently than the rest of us. Now, I mentioned Warren Buffett in a previous lecture and in a previous section, but I want to come back to him one more time. And just as a reminder, he&rsquo;s worth more than 60 billion dollars, and that&rsquo;s with a B and as one of the most successful investors of all time. <em>So what&rsquo;s his secret? His secret is simply saying, no. This is a quote from Mr. Buffett. The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything is sounds too simple, doesn&rsquo;t it? I mean, we can all pronounce the word no. We all know how to say it, but just about all of us don&rsquo;t say it enough. Maybe you&rsquo;re a people pleaser and you want to help others. Or maybe you&rsquo;re ambitious and want to tackle it all</em>. Or maybe you&rsquo;re like my wife and you just have foma fear of missing out. Either way, if you&rsquo;re overwhelmed, this is the place to start. Scott Densmore wrote a great article about a story that he was told to by a friend of his. His friend was a pilot for Warren Buffett at the time. And one day Warren went up to his pilot and jokingly said, the fact that you&rsquo;re still working for me tells me I&rsquo;m not doing my job. <em>You should be out there going after more of your goals and dreams were and then asked the pilot to make a list of his top twenty five priorities or goals just to write them all down on a piece of paper</em>. So I threw out a couple of examples right here on this slide to mimic a little bit of what the pilot went through to jot down some of the top priorities and goals that he might have had once the list was complete.</p>
<p>Warren asked the pilot to review the list and circled the top five that were most important. <strong>And those top five, that would make the biggest impact</strong>, the ones that he prioritized over everything else. And he insisted he could choose only five</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s say, for example, that these were the five. That he chose to enroll in school, you know, maybe take the family to Disney World, see lose 20 pounds and create a website. And moved to Texas, who doesn&rsquo;t want to move to Texas now after these top five were selected, <strong>Warren asked him to create a plan for accomplishing all five</strong>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing earth shattering in this yet, right? Pretty standard stuff. But after they went on to discuss how he was going to accomplish the top five items, Buffett asked the pilot what he planned to do with the remaining 20 items. What are your plans for those? The pilot said, well, those 20 are a close second to my top five, and they&rsquo;re still very important to me. So I&rsquo;ll work on them intermittently as I have time while I&rsquo;m working on my top five items. <strong>Wrong answer. Warren said that those other 20 items are now his avoid at all costs list. No matter what, those things get absolutely no attention until he&rsquo;d succeeded with the other five</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that right there is the magic, the power of focus and saying no and you will hear all the really successful people talk about it. Now, many of us have a to do list, <strong>but how many of us have a not to do list</strong>? Think about the difference in clarity and focus when you have tunnel vision on your top priorities and nothing else, and this is critical not only for your goals, but for your daily activities as well, potential distractions will only increase with new technology. And as you become more and more successful, those are never going to go away. You will need to become more and more successful and skilled as saying no. So you might as well start exercising that muscle now. So let me ask you. What&rsquo;s in your top five? I encourage you to perform the exact same exercise using the page and the resources, write down and just get it all on paper, your top twenty five goals and dreams and really sit down and circle the top five. The most critical five is going to give you 80 percent of your results and take you where you want to go.</p>

<p>How to Use Daily Themes to Enhance Your Productivity</p>
<p>He gives each day of the week a theme so that he can assure that he&rsquo;s not just putting out fires all day and working only on the urgent tasks, but he&rsquo;s working on those things that will really have an impact on the results of both companies</p>
<p>Now, this strategy helps you be intentional on what you&rsquo;re focusing on, but also utilizes the power of batching activities. Batching is simply a type of time management strategy that groups similar tasks that require similar resources together in order to streamline their completion in the most efficient way possible. Now, bashing or using theme days minimizes distraction because it keeps your focus narrow. You&rsquo;re only focused on one item or theme at a time. It also allows you to get into the flow much more easily and be efficient with your resources.</p>
<p>Harvard Business Review, Peter Bregman notes that our productivity goes down by 40 percent when we try to focus on several things at once. In addition to batching, setting a theme to your day really allows you to make sure that you&rsquo;re putting in enough time on the important high value activities that are really going to give you your best results.</p>
