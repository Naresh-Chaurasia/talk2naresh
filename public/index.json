    "content": " Flat Bench Dumbell Press Flat Bench Barbell Press Decline Dumbbell Bench Press Decline Barbell Bench Incline Dumbbell Bench Press Butterflies / Pec Deck / Seated Machine Flyes References   Breath Out When Pushing\n  Breath In When Releasing\n Flat Bench Dumbell Press   Lie on a flat bench holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.\n  Start by holding the dumbbells slightly wider than shoulder width apart above your shoulders. Your palms should be facing forward.\n  Slowly bend your elbows until they are at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are parallel to the ground.\n  Push the weights up by straightening your arms.\n  As you push the weights up, move your arms in an arc to bring the dumbbells together, until they meet over the center of your chest. Hold for a count of one.\n  Lower the dumbbells by slowly bending your elbows back to 90 degrees.\n  Continue lowering your arms until they are a little lower than parallel to the floor. (Your elbows should be pointing slightly towards the floor and you should feel a stretch in your chest muscles and shoulders.)\n  Repeat\n   Flat Bench Barbell Press   Feet should be wide apart and flat on the floor (unless the program tells you otherwise) to give your upper body muscles a solid platform from which they can generate power.\n  Keep your shoulder blades retracted throughout the exercise. Pull them together before you lower the bar, and keep them together as you lift.\n  A grip slightly wider than shoulder width will assure maximum effort from all areas of the chest.\n  Stabilize by ensuring that your shoulders, head, and hips remain in contact with the bench at all times.\n  Keeping your elbow out will ensure you are using more chest and less triceps.\n  Do not bounce the bar off your chest or arch your back – this reduces the amount of chest work and risks injury to the chest muscles. You may arch your back (which provides greater power) to complete a set, but only if you have difficulty with the last repeat and you do not have the help of a fellow athlete.\n  Keep a firm grip on the bar with your forearms approximately perpendicular to the floor and parallel to each other.\n  Avoid dropping the weight quickly.\n  It’s a very good idea to have a spotter on hand who can help lift the bar off your chest if you unexpectedly fail to complete a repetition.\n   Decline Dumbbell Bench Press   Make sure that your legs are steady at the top of the bench—you don’t want to slide down the bench.\n  Use light weight in the beginning, raising and lowering the dumbbells directly over your lower chest.\n  Forcefully press the dumbbells up in an arc (coming toward each other at the top) until your arms are fully extended above your lower chest or upper abs.\n  Your breathing should always be out on extension, which means you are blowing the weight away.\n  Don’t bounce the dumbbells at the bottom of the movement.\n  Flare your elbows out as the bar is lowered to maximize pectoral isolation.\n  It is not advisable to work out intensely for prolonged periods with the head below the level of the heart. This is because the human body is not designed for effort in an inverted posture.\n  The bench should never be set at a decline of more than about 35 degrees.\n   Decline Barbell Bench   Slowly lower the resistance to your collarbone, making a conscious effort to keep your elbows wide. To stretch the chest muscles at the bottom of the movement and work your pectoralis muscle harder, spread your elbows as far from your body as possible and use a pronated grip (thumbs facing each other).\n  The weights should travel perpendicular to the floor.\n  To keep your body stable during the exercise, your knees should be at the end of the bench with your lower legs hanging over the end. There should be a support bar to press your feet against for further stability and to keep you from sliding down.\n  Do not lift your head up and do not bridge or arch.\n  The lower pectoral is best targeted at a decline of 20 to 40 degrees to the floor. Steeper declines shift the focus from the chest to the triceps.\n  The greater the decline angle, the more weight you’ll be able to use (to a point) due to the decreasing range of motion.\n  Have your partner assist by giving you two forced repetitions or two negative repetitions.\n   Incline Dumbbell Bench Press   Make sure that you raise and lower the weights evenly. Avoid jerking or twisting your body to “muscle” them upwards.\n  Keep your back pressed against the bench, your feet flat on the floor.\n  The path the dumbbells travel when performing this exercise is important. When lowering the dumbbells, be sure the initial movement is out and away from your chest rather than straight down. The dumbbells should not hit your chest at the bottom. They should be even and a couple of inches away from the outside part of your chest. Push the dumbbells through the same path on the way up as on the way down.\n  The lower the dumbbells descend, the more the chest muscle stretches. Lowering the dumbbells too far can cause shoulder injury; it is safer to terminate the descent when the dumbbells reach chest level. You should achieve a maximal but comfortable stretch.\n  Keep your forearms vertical under the weights. They should move perpendicular to the ground and parallel to each other.\n  Flare your elbows out wide during descent. Keeping your elbow out will ensure you are using more chest and less triceps.\n  If you are new to this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. The spotter assists by spotting your forearms near your wrists.\n  Do not set the angle of the bench too high otherwise the anterior deltoids will be targeted and take much of the emphasis away from the chest.\n  Butterflies / Pec Deck / Seated Machine Flyes   Sit on a pec deck machine with your back flat against the back rest.\n  Grip the handles and make sure your arms are parallel to the floor. If not parallel,adjust the seat or handles accordingly. This is the start position.\n  Exhale and slowly push the handles together squeezing your chest to the middle as you do so. Hold for a count of one.\n  Inhale as you return to the starting position in a controlled movement.\n  Repeat.\n  References  https://www.anywherefitness.ie/blog/19-variations-of-the-chest-press-exercise https://workoutlabs.com/exercise-guide/dumbbell-bench-press/ https://bodybuilding-wizard.com/flat-barbell-bench-press/  ",

One was my family. One was my job. And most importantly, was my part time business. And I think the part time business is the most sort of important thing, because it was the only way that I could get out of the financial rut that I was in.\n Fence Railing - compartmentalization technique So what then happened was I dedicated two hours a day to the part time business using what we call a compartmentalization technique\n Fence Pillar - Where You Are  Standing in pillar with telescope and watching how far is my goal 3rd and 4th is covered in MAAP  firstly, knowing where you are and where you want to be, this is a pretty obvious statement and you might be thinking, I know where I am in life, but you’ll be surprised that the vast majority of people don’t know where they are in life. They don’t know how far away they are from achieving their goals, if they have any in the first place. They also don’t know what their purpose is. You may be one of them.\nThe second aspect is how you plan to bridge that gap and achieve your goals, planning is a fundamental process that one has to do in order to achieve the goals.\nThe third aspect is how you train your mind to achieve your goals. I have mentioned before that mindset required for achieving success is one of the most crucial factors.\nAnd the fourth aspect is how you everything action is usually what separates a person from achieving anything in life, massive, determined and consistent action is the name of the game.\nThere is a saying that I have always lived by, and it was taught to me by one of my mentors. And and the same goes as follows. Thoughts will determine what you want, but action ultimately determines what you get. We will delve deeper into these four aspects in the chapters to follow.\n Green Bench - MAAP Technique  Sitting on bench and drawing a MAAP  The M stands for mindset, as mentioned before, mindset is a key component that I have highlighted already.\nThe A stands for awareness awareness is knowing exactly what you want out of life, and again, I have spoken about this in detail previously.\nThe A stands for action, so these are the small, incremental actions that you need to do on a daily basis, actions that are in line with your goals.\nAnd finally, the P, which stands for Planning, and again, as highlighted previously, what planning is required to achieve your goals?\n Park 2 Pillar - Awareness When I look at the Pillar, there is images of me looking back.\nSo awareness, as mentioned before, is knowing exactly what you want out of life. And not only that, knowing where you stand currently is also part of that awareness.\nI don’t mean anything materialistic, like a new car, a new house or any other materialistic things, I mean something that’s deeper. And I need you to think long and hard about it. I want you to write. The first few things that actually popped into your mind, and that’s where you write it in this section. So just take time out, pause this video and just do a little bit of brainstorming and what you actually want out of life.\nWhy do you want what you said you want?\n Park 2 Overhead Railing - Mission Statement So most organizations have this mission statement, which is basically a statement that best describes an organization’s key purpose and value and what it is committed to doing.\nSimilarly, you yourself should have a mission statement that clearly describes what you feel like. Your purpose in life is it clearly separates what’s important and what’s not in your life. And it also describes your values.\n Park 1 Overhead Lamp - SMART Specific\nAn example of a broad term goal is a goal such as I would like more money in my life or I would like a promotion at work.\n I would like to earn ten thousand dollars more this year than last year. I would like to be promoted to the position of general manager.  The M stands for measurable, your goals should have some form of monitoring or tracking. So in other words, you should be able to know how far you are away from achieving your goals, whether you’re on track and ultimately finding out when you have finally achieved your goals.\nThe A stands for achievable. So, in other words, how realistic are your goals? Are you able to accomplish it based on your current constraints, such as financial factors or time constraints or resource constraints? Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, I will go back to the example of wanting a promotion at work. You may you may need to step back and ask yourself questions such as do you have the right qualifications or experience to suit that role? If you don’t, then maybe setting another goal, such as developing the experience and qualifications necessary to get that promotion before you actually set the goal of getting a promotion.\nAlso to highlight the example of, for example, wanting more money, you may need to step back and ask yourself, how will you get more money? You won’t get more money by doing the same thing that you’re doing now. So you may need to re-evaluate your goal and change it to having a goal of developing, for example, a second stream of income. That would be a goal prior to having more money.\nThe R stands for relevant, this means that the goal that you have sent have said should be worthwhile and full of meaning to you. Also, is this the right time for you? So, for example, if you would like a promotion at work and your overall goal is to be financially free, then is it worth gaining that extra qualification that you need for gaining that experience? Or should you utilize your time in developing another stream of income? Those are the types of questions that you need to ask yourself.\nThe T stands for time based, you need to set a date or some sort of timeline to achieve your goal. It is absolutely critical to assign this date, this deadline date, as mentally you are now under a deadline to achieve that goal.\n Garden 1 Drainage Pipeline If I don’t take care of my goals, they will go down the Drainage\n adventure goals family goals / relationship goals financial goals health goals  the next stage is to determine which goals are short term, medium term or long term. It’s time to be realistic at this stage, not all goals can be short term\n Penguin Dustbin - Choose at least five The first step in this is to choose at least five to seven short term goals that you feel are priority for each category. Now, the amount of goals that you choose is entirely up to you. You can choose less or more. The important thing here is that it should be comfortable for you and not too overwhelming and at the same time, not too less.\nThe question here is, how relevant is your goal to your overall mission statement? Is it worthwhile? And is this what you really want in life? And time bound now.\nmake it more smarter, the more smarter your goals, the more specific, the more measurable, the more achievable, the more relevant. And the more time bound they are, the higher your chance of actually achieving your goals\n Trees / Forest - Time And when I do this exercise, it brings into perspective that, yes, they do have time. It’s just how that time is managed and how you how you spend that time\n Bench Green Red - Compound Effect So another example is simply reading, for example, 10 pages of a good book every day will equate to reading approximately 10 to 15 books a year\nThen the key to becoming good at them is to know more than what 95 percent of the population know. And the best way to do this is to read books on that particular topic. So, again, if you read an average of 10 to 15 books on a particular topic, then you automatically become an expert in that field. So that’s just food for thought. The reason I’m saying this is that every action that you take towards your goals, no matter how small or trivial they seem, will eventually add up to a bigger result, provided that you remain consistent and determined and that the action is in the right direction\n Speed Breaker - compartmentalization technique But for now, just think of which colors that you want to assign to each of your goal categories\n Gas Pipeline - Belief Systems So belief systems, a simple definition of a belief system is that it is a set of habits which ultimately control an individual’s behavior or actions, both consciously and unconsciously, towards a given task or as a reaction to a given situation\nSo just to refer to the belief system work worksheet. I want you to make a list of your belief systems around the different gold categories once you have made the list of those beliefs, I want you to analyze whether that belief system is in line with your goals\nyour beliefs create your emotions, your emotions, create your actions and your actions ultimately control your outcome\n Fire Hose 1 - Your Current Mental Programming  Bench Green Color  Garden 2 Overhead Railing  Garden 2 Pillar  Garden 2 Overhead Lamp  References  ",

I have to come back to this as often as possible. Make it part of my life and you will live your dreams. Go on Naresh, its time to live your dreams!!! I am keeping some location in Memory Palace unused, if need later for some information.\n  We’re going to teach you a new way to create and store memories, how to triple your reading speed, and we’re going to give you the tools to do rigorous at-home training. It’s not going to be easy. Becoming a super learner is about much, much more than some of the traditional speed reading programmes out there. It’s a comprehensive shift in the way that you learn. This means that we’re going to have to retool the way you learn and remember new information first and foremost. What I’m trying to say is this. You’re going to have to work for this, and it’s not going to happen overnight. But, with the lectures and the worksheets and exercises we’ve provided, you can and you will succeed.\nSo we want you to limit your practice and studying to no more than 8 hours per week, to prevent fatigue, burnout, and frustration, and also to allow your brain the necessary time to adapt and build the new connections and habits we’re going to be studying\nMain Door Front - Progressive Overload Throughout the course, we’re going to be using a training methodology called progressive overload, progressive overload is a fundamental principle at the core of all strength and fitness training, and it’s applicable to your mental skills as well. The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress.\n Main Door Peep Hole - Pomodoro technique Pomodoro technique, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you’ll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you’ll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out\n Main Door Back - Memory Our brains do use several different types of buffers to work with the various types of information. This basically means that words, ideas, images, and scenes, they don’t all use the same path to get to the short term memory.\n Main Door Ganpati - Buffers Well, once you’ve used your working memory to process, understand, and interact with a piece of information, your short term memory is what keeps it in your mind for about 15 to 20 seconds. This might seem like a really short amount of time, and it is, that’s why for the majority of the course, we’re going to focus on improving the connexion all the way from your working memory to your long term memory. This is because if you do a good enough job creating those short term memories that’ll stick till you get to the end of a page or an article, you’ll only need to use some simple review techniques and regular maintenance to keep things in your long term memory, where we eventually want all our new information to remain.\nThis means that right now, our working and short term memory are the primary bottlenecks. Without the right infrastructure and base skillset to improve these two types of memory, speed reading is pretty useless, even impossible\n Main Door Magnetic Stopper - Neural Network But basically memories are created when your brain sends neurotransmitter signals to two neurons at the same time. This strengthens the connexion between those two neurons and presto, you have a new memory. This is an important point to make because it shows that the creation of memories requires connexion between two neurons or a connexion to existing neurons in your brain. The other thing you need to know is that when this happens over and over again the cluster of neurons and their synaptic connexions become something called a neural network. From artificial intelligence research we know that neurons work better in these types of clusters. This means that when several neurons fire together the signal is actually amplified. That’s why it’s so crucial to store memories in several connected neurons and to further connect them to the memories that we often use.\nBecause there are so many connexions and stories and experiences around that piece of information your brain determines that it’s critical and will never erode it away. Knowing this can benefit us tremendously. The process of super learning necessitates that we create more connexions to the information we want to learn\n Wall - neuroplasticity Well first and foremost I want to dispel the myth that children’s brains are somehow better at absorbing new information or that they have a higher neuroplasticity.\nRecent studies have actually shown that this is simply not true. The reason that children seem to learn with more ease is that they’re learning literally every waking hour and all information is new and exciting information for them. Furthermore, research shows that our brains do play by the use it or lose it rule. Most adults lose the ability to learn rapidly simply because they settle into their day-job and they stop learning in the volume that they used to as children, not because their brain chemistry or #neuroplasticity# have actually changed\n Wall Bulb Holder - Games Playing games with Wall Bulb Holder and getting electric shock\nSo, as you go along throughout the rest of the course, I want you to remember that the games are important, but that the real test of your super-learner skills is whether or not you can memorise everyday information, speed-read your daily reading assignments, and learn actual skills faster\n Wall Switch Board on left - Chunking Chunking - psychological phenomenon\nThe chunking system is very good because it’s an entry level mnemonic technique. It’s not only much faster and easier to learn and play with than some of the heavier visual memory techniques we’re going to learn later, but it’s also a critical element of the overall technique. This is to say that even after we teach you the methods to remember things way more easily, you’re still going to be chunking details or memories into groups of three or four so that they can better comply with the requirements of your short term memory. Sure, we could train your short term memory to hold a larger number of items, but that would only slow you down and place a larger cognitive load on you. At three to five items there is no slow down so it’s preferable to work in this range. Furthermore, by chunking groups of items into one entity, we can stack five chunks of five objects each into our working memory and effectively store 25 items in our short term or working memory without any cognitive overload. Because of this massive advantage, you’ll notice that all of the world’s top memory athletes use systems that are based on chunking combined with powerful visual and spatial memory techniques that we’ll be learning later on in the course. The other nice thing about chunking is that it works with just about everything. Take a sequence of numbers or a couple pieces of information. For example, brown dog, tall fence, lost Frisbee. You can even try to chunk information about people into neat little bundles. It might seem strange, but remembering that information in chunks is actually much easier than if it were to be put all together\n Samsung TV 65 Inches - Dual Coding and Brute Force Learning Dual Coding. Remember how we learned that the brain has different buffers for working memory depending on the type of information it’s interacting with?\nA great example of this, by the way, would be to try and explain to some of your friends what you learned in the last few lectures about your memory and about chunking. By teaching this information, you force your brain to look at it from a different angle, to deconstruct it, to form it into your own words, and then to present it in a compelling way. As they say, something once taught is something twice learned, and we would absolutely love to see you get out there and share what you’ve learned with your friends so far\n Samsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer - Visual Memory \u0026 Marker Well, it means that we can not only spot an approaching predator very quickly, we can also remember visual information, or pictures, far faster and with more clarity than we can remember things like spoken words\nIt also has to do with the fact that pictures are more heavily encoded and they speak to different types of working memory buffers, as we mentioned before. Pictures are imbued with rich and detailed information, such as colour, context, shape, and size, and they’re more likely to have a higher number of neural connexions, as they convey emotion and depth, interaction, and so much more. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. Visual information is also alarmingly fast. Research has demonstrated that we can comprehend the contents of an image in just a fraction of a second\nThis little demonstration shows us just how effective it is to see things as pictures and symbols rather than auditory information. For this reason, in addition to all the other steps we have to take to prime our memory, it’s best that we also learn to transform concepts, ideas, and other important information into imagined visual pictures, or what we call markers, as soon as we possibly can. It won’t surprise you to learn, additionally, that the best and most memorable types of visual markers are strange, bizarre, or emotionally connected to memories. After all, adult learners need to connect information to pre-existing knowledge, and as always, our hippocampi are busy working away to determine what stuff matters and what stuff doesn’t\nShe explained to me that she struggled a great deal with this first memorization assignment. This is because they were simply looking at the bones in a diagram, a very undetailed image in a textbook without any emotional connexion or experiential component to it\nHowever, the detailed, experiential images, the emotionally significant experience of interacting with a dead body, and the very concrete, minute details are what allowed her to memorise the ligaments much better than the bones\nUltimately, you have to learn to go with what images come naturally for you. Try to lean towards whatever type of image you find most conductive for you to remember, but just make sure that, number one, there’s as much detail as possible.\nYou’ll also probably develop fixed markers for subjects that you spend a lot of time reading about.\nWith time, you too will build up a visual library like this one, which will make calling up images much faster and make it much easier to link together strings of images to form complex concepts that easily convert into long term memory.\n Samsung 11.1.4 Subwoofer Table - Visual Memory \u0026 Reading How Do We Apply Visual Memory To Reading\nOne of those future lectures will come up when we get to speed reading, and it’ll explain in detail how you’ll use regular intervals of pauses during your reading. This is not just because speed reading is very exhausting for the eyes and for the brain, but also because these pauses allow us to optimise the process of learning\nYou see, just like there are at least three types of memory, there are also three stages, or processes, of memory. They are, encoding, storage, and retrieval. Where most people get into trouble is that they try to do all three at once. Have you ever read a paragraph or a page of text only to realise that you’ve been deeply immersed in thought and you haven’t actually paid attention to anything that you just read? This is what happens when you’re trying to do all three memory processes at once. On the other hand, if you’ve ever studied process operations management or economics, you know that grouping similar tasks together is an efficient way to minimise waste. I mean, you don’t wash one shirt at a time and then put it in the dryer all by itself. You wash all of your clothes together, put them all in the dryer together, and then fold them when they’re all done, right? With reading, you’ve been doing it one shirt at a time, trying to multitask the washing and drying and folding for each shirt. It’s just as inefficient as it sounds, and so we’re going to separate it out into three separate processes to reduce cognitive strain and improve overall efficiency\nNow I know what you’re thinking, how exactly do we do that? Well, because of the limitations on your short term memory and the inherent difficulty in multitasking visualisation with reading, we’ll be learning how to make short pauses of about one to two seconds after each page, or even take micro pauses of just fractions of a second after reading information-dense paragraphs. You’ll also take longer pauses every 10 minutes or less to review what you’ve already hopefully put into the beginning stages of long term memory. As we’re going to discover, when we learn about space repetition software, you brain needs to periodically repeat and review information in increasingly long intervals in order to remember it and prove to the hippocampi that it’s relevant and worth remembering. This is similar to the idea that you must continue weight training to improve your strength and increase muscle mass. If your brain, like your body, thinks that the information you’re using is a one off occurrence, it won’t waste the time investing the resources to remember it.\nIn short, this is why we take small pauses after each page and much longer pauses of 15 to 30 seconds after each chapter, to play back and retrieve our stored markers and perform a form of spaced repetition to improve our long term retention. This also means that it’s not a bad idea to spend a few minutes a week reviewing markers and ideas from books you’ve read months or even years before, if you really wish to remember them\nWhile we’re discussing images and visual markers, it’s worth noting that not all markers have to be visual. In fact, smell is actually a more memorable sense than vision. Of course, we can’t understand an entire book using our sense of smell alone, and so we’re focusing on images, but if you read about, say, chocolate, and you can conjure up the smell or the taste of chocolate, that’s actually a great marker for remembering that data point. And if it works for you, even better. Whatever types of markers we use, whether they’re visual or sensory or some other types that we have yet to learn about, it’ll almost certainly be a mix in the end. This mix of markers, when retrieved and reviewed, reminds us of the details that we’ve decided we need to remember. And when combined with our existing knowledge and opinions and ideas about the content, it allows us to dual code and store information into long term memory very quickly and very effectively\nSo, instead of reading back over the chapter, we can retrieve all of the markers we’ve created and start thinking about how they’re connected together logically. We play them back almost like a film strip in our minds, and that helps our retrieval\n Samsung 11.1.4 Bar TV Unit Top (Light Brown, Old) TV Unit Middle Drawer - TV Unit Left Slot - TV Unit Middle Slot - TV Unit Right Slot -   Kitchen Curtain : Starting with Kitchen Curtain Kitchen Counter / Platform Kitchen Top Drawer Unit White in Color (First Up) Kitchen Top Drawer Unit Red in Color (Second Down) Corner Unit Gas Stove Gas Chimney (First Up) Kitchen Window (Upper) Water Tank/Tunki Kitchen Sink Dustbin (Blue in Color) Microwave (Silver in Color) Microwave Stand (With Wheels) Fridge (Blood Red / Passion / Poison Color)    Diwan (Chocolate in Color) : : Starting with Diwan Balcony Window Sofa Set Dinning / Sofa Table Window Platform Blinds Corner Table Telephone Speaker (Ceiling) Tubelight Projector  ",

I am able to recollect the entire course in \u003c 5 minutes. Thanks to Memory Palace and Jonathan Levi. I will always be greatful to you.\n Ramp - Fear Fear and Our Brain’s Default Setting\nIf I had to pick the number one silent killer of our productivity and the biggest thing that holds people back from being as productive as they can possibly be, that would be your own brain and its desire to keep you safe.\nNow, all of us struggle with procrastination from time to time. In fact, in many cases, our procrastination is simply a symptom of fear, whether it be fear of failure, being concerned we won’t live up to expectations or produce good enough work, or even if it’s just a task that’s outside of our comfort zone, we’ll rationalize reason after reason.\nBut it’s not just physical harm that your brain is trying to protect you from. It’s also emotional harm.\nBut because our brain doesn’t distinguish the difference between physical or emotional harm, it wants to avoid both.\nCourage is not the absence of fear. It’s the willingness to act in spite of fear.\n Dance Fear - Forgetting Steps, Taking a lot of time to learn, Upset when girl says no.\n Practise and Make a Routine for different dance forms.\n   AWS Exam Fear - Device a System, that will help you learn and remember things. To begin with, memory palace and association looks great options.\n Let this be 1st thing that you want to do daily.\n   Canada Fear - There is nothing much you can do about it. Keep doing proper follow up and thats all for now.\n  Seating Arc - Overwhelm Overwhelm - How it holds you back and how you can beat it\nNow, here’s the thing. When your brain gets overwhelmed, it’s kind of like a breaker being shut off. Your brain just completely shuts down. Now, I hear this from my clients and my students all the time. They’re overwhelmed and they don’t even know where to start. And in many cases, when this happens, they freeze, it paralyzes them and they’re just stuck in the mud. But the problem is those tasks don’t go away. That only makes the problem worse. I do have some good news for you. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. You see, overwhelm really is subjective. It’s much more of an emotion that it is a reality. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way. Please don’t leave this lecture without really internalizing this fact. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way.\nThe first thing you’ve got to do when you get overwhelmed is to get all those thoughts out of your head.\nAnd once you’ve got it on paper, you can then start to organize it and create a plan\n Soft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\n  Technical Course - So many and which one to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\n  ToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do. Whatever comes to mind, write it down.\n  Daily Activities - So many of them. Make exhaustive list of everything.\n  Soil/Earth - Plan Failing To Plan\nThe first thing that planning is going to do for you is provide clarity now, planning forces you to get clear on what it is you actually want to accomplish. It allows you to really decide how to invest your time and what your most important tasks are. Now, as silly as this sounds, many don’t even know. And it sounds simple, I know, but I can’t tell you how often when I sit down to write out the three most important tasks that I want to accomplish that day, how frequently I pause and have to really give it some serious thought. This is a really critical first step. Another key benefit of having a plan is the locks you in. And once you lock in to your priorities of the day, it’s really going to help you lock out all the distractions and all the things that pop up along the way. They can get you sidetracked. And lastly, a plan creates great subconscious accountability. When you’ve got a system and you’ve got a plan and you actually write out what your top priorities are for the day, I’m telling you, it will nag at you until you get it done. And I’ve found that this will at least double your chance of actually completing that task if you commit to it in writing. Please don’t underestimate the power behind this particular advantage, because be honest, we all love Crosson. Those things off our To-Do list. Now, if you don’t consistently plan your week and plan your day and you’re not doing that already, your job is to start planning your day and planning your week before the end of this course, I’m going to get into more depth and walk through this in more detail in future lectures. But like Benjamin Franklin said, failure to plan is planning to fail.\n Soft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do !\n Follow the plan on Notion.\n   Technical Course - So many and which one to do !\n  ToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do !\n  Daily Activities - So many of them !\n  Vehilce Mirror - Perfect Waiting for Things to Be Perfect\nOur next silent killer of productivity is waiting for things to be perfect, you see, unproductive people are great at waiting for the time to be right. They’re great at waiting until they feel like it, waiting until they’re in the mood to get started. The door of opportunity is right there for them to walk through it, but they’re waiting for it to open now. Rarely does the perfect time ever come. So let’s take a look at our rocket right here. Now, with the rocket such as this one, there’s something called escape velocity. Now, a rocket must reach a speed of about seven miles per second to escape the earth’s pull of gravity. But almost all of that energy is needed at the beginning when a rocket first launches. You and I are no different. But the good news is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion and all you need to do to get started is to get started and the rest will usually take care of itself.\n On the dance floor, you will never be prefect. Enjoy the journey, not destination.\n  Tree - Multi-Tasking The Myth of Multi-Tasking\nSo this next silent killer of productivity might surprise you is multitasking\nWe’re only able to actually focus deeply on one task at a time. In fact, according to one researcher, instead of making you more productive, multitasking can actually double the amount of time it takes you to complete a specific task while also potentially doubling your mistakes. That’s a pretty significant mental cost. And to make matters worse, when you get distracted. It takes you almost 15 minutes on average to get fully back in the flow\nou’ve got to turn that phone off, shut off your email alerts and put everything else aside. And just by focusing on your most important task, first, by blocking off that time, specifically where all you focus on is that critical task, you’ll see huge results\npath of diminishing returns\n Mobile is a big distractor. Follow 1 hour strategy\n  Fence Wall - Fake Breaks Time Leaks \u0026 Fake Breaks\n I am sitting on the Fence Wall, and taking Fake Breaks\n Your brain and your body does need time to rejuvenate and needs breaks in order to perform this optimal level. But these types of activities, surfing the web, checking your email, looking at your Facebook page, these are fake breaks. They don’t actually reset your willpower, reset your focus or help you increase your energy. They’re actually making it worse now\n Fence Railing - Emotional Poor Emotional and Energy Managment / EE\nAmy Cuddy is a social psychologist and professor at Harvard Business School, delivered a great TED talk that shows the power of influence we have on ourselves and specifically regarding the way that we use our own body. In her studies, she put participants into high powered poses or low power poses for just two minutes now. You’ll see over here on the left, we’ve got our high power poses. This one right here has been dubbed the Wonder Woman Pose. But in each one of these scenarios, you’ll see that they’re making their body wide and or expanding their stance, and over here on the right hand side, you’re going to see low power poses. They’re making themselves small or closing their body language. And after just two minutes, they test the participants hormone levels to see if it had any effect. And quite frankly, I found the findings astounding. Now, those who struck the high power pose, so a 20 percent increase in testosterone and a 25 percent decrease in cortisol, cortisol being a hormone most times associated with stress and those that spent two minutes in the low power poses saw a 10 percent decrease in testosterone and a 15 percent increase in cortisol\n Speed Limit - Email One of the biggest Silent Killers of Productivity\n Visitor Parking - Time Managment L Shape - Time Managment V/s Self Management (Small L V/s Big L).\nAnd whether we like it or not, each minute is only made up 60 seconds and each week one hundred and sixty eight hours. And those are going to pass us by at the same speed no matter what we do. And in reality, when we’re talking about time management, what we really should be talking about is self-management, because the one and only thing that we have one hundred percent total control over is what we do and how we manage that time. Now, my suggestion is don’t wish you had more time. Instead, wish you had better self-management, better systems, better tactics, better habits, and probably most importantly, better execution on the stuff that you already know how to do and actually put it in a play which you already know you should be doing but aren’t doing. These are the things that really make a difference. And these are the things that you have. One hundred percent total control over time. If you don’t know how to manage yourself, if you don’t know how to set up and actually consistently use the right systems, it wouldn’t matter if you could make more time up here. You wouldn’t be able to fully take advantage of that extra time. So I’m going to encourage you right from the start to instill a new belief. And it’s not about time management. It’s about self management and making the most of the time that you already have. Because if you do make the most of that time that you already do have, you’re going to double and triple the results that you’re getting now.\n Start using in-door cycle and rowing machine, while watching movies\n  Overhead Park Fencing / Railing - Spending Time Spending Time vs Investing Time. A big clock hanging, and time is ticking.\nNow, one of the biggest mistakes, I think unhappy, broke and unsuccessful people make is in thinking short term versus long term when making decisions.\nAnd most people, myself included in the past, is typically focused on how they’re spending their time each day instead of focusing on how they’re investing their time\nAnd there’s a huge difference now when most people think of time management productivity, it’s in regards to getting the maximum number of things done in a day, a week or a year. But I’m going to encourage you to look at it from another perspective. When you invest in something, you hope that will give you a return that’s greater than what you invested. For example, if you put five dollars into a stock, you hope to get much more than that, five dollars over time. And I encourage you to look at time the exact same way. Spending your time is about getting things done, investing your time is about setting up systems and delegating tasks that will literally save you hours and create new hours in the future.\nNow, many people won’t take the time to train someone else to do that task or automate that task because it usually requires more effort in the short run.\nMany of the people that I speak with, a lot of them have trouble delegating and letting go. But once you understand the difference between spending your time and getting more time back in the future by investing your time, it becomes a real game changer.\nSo focus more on time investing activities that will pay you back each and every single day and are going to make you more and more productive.\n Identify tasks where there is scope for investing time\n  Speed Breaker - Sleep The Importance of Sleep to Your Productivity\nAccording to the University of Pennsylvania, if you get six hours of sleep per night for two weeks straight, which is a little less probably than you need, your mental and physical performance declines at the same level as if you stayed awake for 48 hours straight.\nAnother solution can be to take what I call a power nap. And most sleep research will suggest to keep it to less than 30 minutes to keep it from interfering with your normal sleep schedules and circadian rhythms. Even something as small as a 20 minute nap has been proven to improve your memory\n Let power nap be power nap\n  Gas Bank Door - Water The Healthiest Energy Drink That Most of Us Have Access to For Free!\nWhen your brain is fully hydrated, you think faster, you’re more focused, you have more creativity and more clarity. But most importantly, you’d be more productive. While your brain only makes up about three percent of your body mass, it actually uses up to 20 percent of the water and nutrients that you take in. And just like with sleep deprivation that we just got done talking about, even small amounts of dehydration can lead to big effects. Just one percent of dehydration can lead to a five percent cognitive decline\nIf you’re not sleep deprived and you don’t have as much energy as normal usually is because of dehydration.

You can direct your attention to those things that are going well, things that are great in your life, things that are where you want them to be, and things that are within your control. And when you do that, how do you feel? You might feel a sense of gratitude, hope, appreciation and progress. But what if you instead choose to focus on what’s missing in your life, what’s going wrong, and focusing on all the things that maybe you’re going wrong in that are missing, that you can’t even control in that instance, how do you feel\nThe tough part is that most of our thoughts and behaviors are habits, the things that we do and thoughts that we think over and over again without even really giving it any conscious thought. So over time, you’ve developed automatic patterns and you habitually lean towards thinking one way or the other\nAnother major contributor to your mood is how you’re using your body at any given moment. As I mentioned in that earlier lecture, studies have shown that something as simple as how you use your body posture and have a hormonal effect specifically as it relates to testosterone and cortisol\n Gas Bank Window - Will Power How Will Power Really Works - I can sticker all over the window\n Lover’s Point - Knowing and Doing Knowing and Doing Are Completely Different Things\nGive me a mediocre idea that’s flawlessly executed and I will win every single time over a genius idea that never gets off the ground. Now, most people love to put their focus on the latest and greatest thing, the new idea, the sexy idea. But those that execute the fundamentals actually get the best results\now, I’m sure you’ve heard the term knowledge is power, but I disagree. I don’t think knowledge really is power. I truly believe that knowledge is potential power, potential power, but only power, if actually acted upon and used that real power comes from its application or execution because without action, there’s no results\n Basketball Board - The Warren Buffet Productivity Secret I think one of the best ways to get better results is to model with the ultra successful people do sustain success is never one hundred percent luck. That just happens to people. Those who are really successful always leave a trail of clues. They simply approach things differently than the rest of us. Now, I mentioned Warren Buffett in a previous lecture and in a previous section, but I want to come back to him one more time. And just as a reminder, he’s worth more than 60 billion dollars, and that’s with a B and as one of the most successful investors of all time. So what’s his secret? His secret is simply saying, no. This is a quote from Mr. Buffett. The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything is sounds too simple, doesn’t it? I mean, we can all pronounce the word no. We all know how to say it, but just about all of us don’t say it enough. Maybe you’re a people pleaser and you want to help others. Or maybe you’re ambitious and want to tackle it all. Or maybe you’re like my wife and you just have foma fear of missing out. Either way, if you’re overwhelmed, this is the place to start. Scott Densmore wrote a great article about a story that he was told to by a friend of his. His friend was a pilot for Warren Buffett at the time. And one day Warren went up to his pilot and jokingly said, the fact that you’re still working for me tells me I’m not doing my job. You should be out there going after more of your goals and dreams were and then asked the pilot to make a list of his top twenty five priorities or goals just to write them all down on a piece of paper. So I threw out a couple of examples right here on this slide to mimic a little bit of what the pilot went through to jot down some of the top priorities and goals that he might have had once the list was complete.\nWarren asked the pilot to review the list and circled the top five that were most important. And those top five, that would make the biggest impact, the ones that he prioritized over everything else. And he insisted he could choose only five\nSo let’s say, for example, that these were the five. That he chose to enroll in school, you know, maybe take the family to Disney World, see lose 20 pounds and create a website. And moved to Texas, who doesn’t want to move to Texas now after these top five were selected, Warren asked him to create a plan for accomplishing all five.\nThere’s nothing earth shattering in this yet, right? Pretty standard stuff. But after they went on to discuss how he was going to accomplish the top five items, Buffett asked the pilot what he planned to do with the remaining 20 items. What are your plans for those? The pilot said, well, those 20 are a close second to my top five, and they’re still very important to me. So I’ll work on them intermittently as I have time while I’m working on my top five items. Wrong answer. Warren said that those other 20 items are now his avoid at all costs list. No matter what, those things get absolutely no attention until he’d succeeded with the other five.\nNow that right there is the magic, the power of focus and saying no and you will hear all the really successful people talk about it. Now, many of us have a to do list, but how many of us have a not to do list? Think about the difference in clarity and focus when you have tunnel vision on your top priorities and nothing else, and this is critical not only for your goals, but for your daily activities as well, potential distractions will only increase with new technology. And as you become more and more successful, those are never going to go away. You will need to become more and more successful and skilled as saying no. So you might as well start exercising that muscle now. So let me ask you. What’s in your top five? I encourage you to perform the exact same exercise using the page and the resources, write down and just get it all on paper, your top twenty five goals and dreams and really sit down and circle the top five. The most critical five is going to give you 80 percent of your results and take you where you want to go.\n I want to learn to DANCE  Make a plan Udemy Course on dance for Shuffle Udemy Salsa Udemy Kizomba   I want to do certification (AWS, TOGAF) I want to have good physique  Work on weak spots Yoga, Stretching and Weight training.

Now, here’s a way you might go about figuring out what that task is, and you can ask yourself what is the one thing that if you accomplished it today, would make your day a success and would make everything else that follows easier\n Basketball Board Pole Support - Your Productivity Secret Weapon The biggest challenges with many of these tasks is that they lack a deadline\n Basketball Court Inner Circle - Parkinson’s Law Using Parkinson’s Law to Your Advantage\nI highly encourage you to challenge yourself with aggressive deadlines, to really take your productivity to the next level\n Basketball Court Outer Circle - Themes How to Use Daily Themes to Enhance Your Productivity\nHe gives each day of the week a theme so that he can assure that he’s not just putting out fires all day and working only on the urgent tasks, but he’s working on those things that will really have an impact on the results of both companies\nNow, this strategy helps you be intentional on what you’re focusing on, but also utilizes the power of batching activities. Batching is simply a type of time management strategy that groups similar tasks that require similar resources together in order to streamline their completion in the most efficient way possible. Now, bashing or using theme days minimizes distraction because it keeps your focus narrow. You’re only focused on one item or theme at a time. It also allows you to get into the flow much more easily and be efficient with your resources.\nHarvard Business Review, Peter Bregman notes that our productivity goes down by 40 percent when we try to focus on several things at once. In addition to batching, setting a theme to your day really allows you to make sure that you’re putting in enough time on the important high value activities that are really going to give you your best results.\n Basketball Court Center - Resurrecting Your Dead Time Lately I am watching a lot of movies.

Identifying EQ Around You Common signs of low EQ. Examples of the high EQ Using EQ in Daily Life  Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5    What is Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize how your emotions are governing your decisions and your thinking. Once you know how emotions affect you, physically and mentally, you are able to learn how to change your reactions. This does not mean changing your emotions or hiding them. What is means is that, you want to identify your emotions and understand why you are feeling a certain way and be more aware of what to do differently and how to do things differently.\nSo bascially, EQ is about identifying how you feel and taking an opportunity to decide how your emotions are helping or hindering you in the work you do and the relationships you have.\nEQ V/s IQ A high IQ doesn’t predict success at work. EQ is a much more reliable indicator of success at work. Whereas People with high EQ are the majority of the top performers. They make better work decisions for themselves, their peers, and their companies. They are well situated to take on exciting opportunities within and outside of their organizations and they make more money than people with low EQ. Executives with high EQ are more likely to succeed than those with high IQ.\nThe EQ Model The concept of emotional intelligence can be broken down into four sections.\nSelf-awareness Your ability to be aware of your feelings in the moment, as they are developing. You feel them and you understand why they are there. It’s about getting to know yourself, listening to yourself, your body, your mind, and your heart. It’s about being self-aware. As your body physically reacts to people and situations, are you feeling the changes?\nSelf-management It involves managing your emotions and the resulting reactions. What you say and do. How well are you managing your emotions? Are you allowing them to drive what you say, think, and do? This isn’t about putting your emotions into a box and sealing it closed. It’s about actively overseeing your reactions.\nSocial awareness It is your ability to recognize and respond to the needs of others. Now some people at work express their needs openly such as I’m frustrated and I need help. Others may not be as explicit with their feelings. You may have to learn how to “read” those people and then to ask questions. People with high social awareness are observing and listening to people. They are empathetic.\nRelationship management It involves considering your emotions as well as those of others as you develop and master relationships. People skilled at Relationship Management build bonds with others. They value teamwork and collaboration, and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nYour Brain and EQ Evolution plays a trick on us humans in such situations because our brains are wired to process and react with big emotions before processing in a logical fashion. In other words you might react emotionally in tiny invisible ways or big bold ways before reacting logically.\nBut research has confirmed that your brain is flexible, malleable and changeable. You can decide to behave more logically rather then being emotionally hijacked. What this means to you is that you can change your behavior, and decide your response in trying and unpleasant circumstance.\nHow to Improve EQ The first and foremost way to increase your EQ you need to learn how to identify the emotions. It begins with understanding how you feel in the grip of emotions. Your body may feel the emotions before you actually “get it”\nLearn Why You Feel It: Once you begin to note how you feel, the second step in self-awareness is to connect the feeling with the reason or cause. Your body might show signs as a result of emotions, even before you realize what’s going on. When you are able to feel a physical sign of it, you will become better at understanding what is happening and why. The people, places, events, times of the day that create a certain emotional reaction. So you’re starting to read your body which is fabulous. Now you need to write down the situations that make you feel one way or another.\nWhat Are Your Buttons?: To change your EQ you need to start with information about the people, places, and times of the day, and so forth, that cause you to respond in ways that are ineffective or unproductive. What pushes your buttons? What provokes you, creates a strong emotional reaction? Is it a silent or covert reaction? You’re fuming on the inside but you’re smiling on the outside. Or, is it a loud one? Having an expression on your face that says it all. Once you identify and become self-aware of your buttons you can begin to manage them, as follows:\n Identify where in your body you are feeling stress, anxiety, excitement, and so forth. This is the “Feel It” part of the exercise. Next connect the dots by considering the situation you find yourself in when you get sweaty, your mouth is parched, you feel lightheaded, or so forth. This is the “Place It” part of the exercise. These situations are your buttons. Buttons that when they’re pushed, they bother you. Final step, think about and describe why you feel a certain way in a certain situation.  The above steps will help you to understand and manage your emotions, and use the emotions in constructive and productive manner.\nMistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development  Becoming too cautious about showing your emotions. They assume that having high EQ means lowering emotional reactions or limiting feelings. That’s false. Remember you are a human, not a robot. Emotions can be managed, not bottled up. Worrying about offending people. EQ leads you to a deeper consideration of what you want to express, with your words, emotions, and actions. Don’t avoid giving solid thoughtful constructive feedback because you are cautious of hurting someone else’s feelings. EQ is the solution to everything. I wish this were the case, but it’s not. EQ isn’t the answer to all of your challenges at work. I’m sure you’re aware of some projects that require hard skills right now, more than soft skills. For example, EQ won’t help you grow your programming skills. So be sure to view your professional development as a balance of hard and soft skills. Failing to ask people to support you. Don’t keep your EQ progress a secret. Remember that emotional intelligence is the leading indicator of success at work. So why not share your interest and ask for support as you build it?  Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Relationship management is your understanding of your emotions and how you use that ability to manage interactions with others, in a manner that leads to success for both sides or parties. People skilled at relationship management build bonds with each other. They value teamwork and collaboration and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nIdentifying EQ Around You Social awareness is your ability to observe what others are saying with their words, and with their bodies, and to examine how it affects you.\nSo the first part of strong social awareness involves watching and listening to others. The second part is learning more about the people you work with so you can better understand how to shift your approaches to partnering with them. You learn what people respond to and what they don’t. You learn what they like and what they appreciate and what they don’t enjoy. You don’t need to have a different or unique approach for every single person you work with. You need to start paying more attention to their signals. They are sending them all the time, all day long.\nCommon signs of low EQ.  Emotional outbursts. Sudden outbursts that are not a regular occurrence or a trend in this person’s behavior. Passive-aggressive behavior. Someone who is filled with frustration on the inside yet avoids confrontation or honest expression of feelings. Big Reactions. Allowing small things to cause big reactions. Someone who gets stressed easily and can blow some things out of proportion. Failing to ask how others feel. Even when other people show emotions in their faces, their bodies, and in non-verbals. Inability to read social cues from others. Doesn’t take the time to read or pay attention to some signals. Self-centeredness. It’s all about him or her, all the time. Lack of empathy. Someone who is unable to understand and share the emotions of others. Lack of emotion, avoids showing their feelings at any time, stoic. Lack of self-awareness. Someone who doesn’t know his or her buttons, has no idea what sets them off. Blaming others for his or her mistakes.  Examples of the high EQ  Asking questions for clarity when receiving criticism Listening, 100 percent. And listening, before speaking. The ability to apologize without being nudged to do so Showing passion, frustration, anxiety, the full range of emotions, yet in an appropriate manner. Learning. People with high EQ are looking for ways to improve, to learn. Sharing praise and criticism, openly and with details. Demonstrating empathy. Reading emotions and relating to them. Being assertive but not aggressive. Making mistakes and freely admitting it. Wow, that’s a huge sign of high EQ. Number ten. Valuing the goals of the team and the organization above his or her own.  Using EQ in Daily Life The best way to work on EQ is to actually start using it in Daily Life. In this section, I will capture how I have been using EQ in my life, and dealing with emotionally stressful, anxious and stressful situations.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 ",

As for any habit change, the key is to form new habits in place of ineffective ones, and that requires initial practice and conscious effort. The good news is that this is easy to implement.\nMy reading strategy has 3 steps: 1. Scanning the territory I am exploring, and defining my learning needs I always read with a clear purpose in my mind, which primes the brain to identify and prioritise the key ideas, and I only read books that serve my strategic purpose and which capture my interest and energise me.

When reading non-fiction, you don’t have to read one book at a time. Where did this idea even come from? Reading to learn should be goal-oriented, and it should be fuelled by energy and interest. So let’s unpack the process of learning from books.\nStep 1: Define your reading radar and learning needs The key to remembering the ideas and books that matter, is to deeply integrate the key ideas that are most useful to you. This is stating the obvious, but many people make the mistake of trying to read everything the same way and in the same depth. So by reducing your head clutter, you reduce the cognitive overwhelm that overloads and exhausts your mind.\nSo what does reading strategically mean? By being strategic, you will only study deeply the books (or chapters) that you will benefit from the most.\nI am always scanning Amazon, blogs and other sources of book recommendations. I have a list of topic areas that are of interest to me, and I tell people that I know are knowledgable in these topics. Recommendations or discoveries that hit my radar get a quick scan of reviews on Amazon or Google, followed by a buy or leave decision. If you have Blinkist (a book summary app) then this is a great way to get a fast overview of a book, and short-cut this process. I keep a list of books on my radar, and I regularly review it.\nIf I have 3 or more books on my radar across all topics on my reading map, I will speed read them first (Google “speed read” and you’ll find resources and tips). On first pass I scan the contents pages, read the chapter summaries, and then flick quickly through every page scanning for diagrams, bullet points, and content headings for interesting clues. I will then selectively skim read parts of chapters, to evaluate quality and overlap with other books I’ve scanned.\nStep 2: Define clear goals for reading every book What are my reading goals? If I don’t know, my interest is not peaked my brain is not primed to receive information in the right mode. So I will aimlessly wander into a book and potentially waste time.\nWhen I moved to Spain from the UK, I had to learn the language fast, from scratch. I learned from my language teacher Rocio that there are two types of vocabulary: “passive” and “active.” Passive vocab are all the words that you understand when you hear them, but that you find hard to access when you want to express yourself. These words are on the tip of your tongue, but just beyond your recall. Active vocab is all the vocab you can use when try to express something, without thinking consciously or searching for words. With use, vocab becomes an automatic component of your repertoire for communicating and moves from passive to active.\nIdeas and concepts are committed to memory in a similar way. So I read in one of three learning modes:\nPassive reading - to acquire general knowledge\nI’m reading for the pleasure of learning, and to stay up to speed and hope to stumble on great ideas and tools.\nThe goal for general knowledge reading is simply to enjoy the stimulation of new ideas, without the need to make copious notes or worry about forgetting things. I just accept that general knowledge reading enters into passive memory, and let go of worrying about recall. But if I sat down to recall the key topics and insights of the book, I might struggle.\nActive reading - to scan for solutions\nThe brain will not let go of problems. They circulate round and round in your thoughts. That’s why in GTD (Getting Things Done, the book by David Allen) he tells us for every to-do that we have, we should identify the first thing that needs to be actioned, and then commit when you will do it. Having done this, your brain will let go of worry, knowing that the task is scheduled. If you don’t do this, your mind will be full of worry about all the things that you need to do.\nSolution-seeking is easy because the brain wants to solve your problems. Relevant ideas and tools just jump out at you. The focus of reading is to first understand, and then capture solutions or ideas as they occur to you.\nActive reading - for deep integration\nThis is reading to deeply integrate ideas that are valuable to your career know-how and life goals, and that add to your specialist expertise or professional insights. You want to commit this knowledge to long term “active” memory.\nThese are the books that your first scan suggested are worth deeply reading. Usually I find such books are harder reading material, either because their concepts and ideas are new or challenging to me, or because they are densely packed with research or tightly argued and complex. They demand more time to digest, and are worthy of the investment.\nThese books I will usually read at least twice, and hold for future reference. So my goal is to understand the ideas on the first reading, and capture content to return to. The second reading is to digest, evaluate and decide how to take action on the new knowledge. We want on the second reading to commit the key ideas to long term memory, using all the methods in Step 3.\nStep 3: The right methods to connect, distill and chunk ideas So we’ve identified books that we need to actively capture in longer term memory.\nThe heart of your reading strategy is your choice of methods for digesting and committing to memory what you learn. Note taking is the basic vehicle for most of us (unless you are Dyslexic like Richard Branson, or have a photographic memory like Elon Musk). I use mind maps extensively, plus I capture in the Evernote app all my bullet point summaries of key ideas or quotes and research references.\nI use mind maps to make connections, and mentally sort my ideas out. You can read more how I do this here: Tom Board’s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.\nI use Evernote for word-based note taking, in order to make my reading easily accessible in future, after my memory has faded. I can also structure captured ideas in folders for specific projects or further study. Evernote is fully searchable, even for PDFs and photographed hand-written notes. You can also tag notes, create folders, add web links, record audio, or use a digital pen on the iPad.\nThere are three main memory hacks that I use regularly, depending on the situation:\nBuild a “mind palace”\n  This is an ancient method, which I learned from one of Derren Brown’s short audio books (Memory Tricks I think it was called). It goes like this. Think of a walk that you do often, and know intimately, or a house or other building that you similarly know inside-out. Then mentally associate places or rooms with what you want to remember, in the order you want to remember it.\n  Each subject is located in a place on your route, or a room in the building, and you use imagination to associate objects in your memory with the subjects you want to recall. The more outrageous the images, the better for memory recall. Run through mentally the rooms/walk until you can recall these images and subjects reliably. This method is used, I am told, by many TED speakers for presentations. It’s useful if you need to recall information in a certain order, for a well-defined purpose. You can mentally ‘clear’ your walk or palace once an event or situation has passed, and re-programme your mind.\n  Simplify and chunk\n  Simplification consists of distilling and prioritising what is important, and so de-cluttering the memory of the less important stuff to remember. You can use post-it notes, or just make lists, to sift and prioritise ideas. The ‘expert disease’ is to think that everything is important, and so discard nothing. This just overwhelms your short term memory.\n  Chunking is a deeper method of ordering information so that you can hold more complex ideas in your short term memory, and think about them. Research shows that you have 3/4 “memory slots” in short term memory. If you try to hold more than 3/4 things in your head at once, you start to struggle. But chunking is a method of hacking this short term memory bottleneck, by grouping ideas. You can read more about chunking in the Quora post here: Tom Board’s answer to How can I expand my ability to think deeply? I struggle to grasp complex ideas presented in tough classes such as physics and economics.\n  Find helpful metaphors\n Our minds think in metaphors. Metaphors can be simple and generic like “up” or “down” or broad like “country” or specific like “the genome project” or “waste basket” as in the Apple desktop or the physical bin in your office or study. You can associate metaphors with new ideas or concepts, to make them easier to recall. If I say to myself that Malcolm Gladwell’s book Tipping Point “is like the moment I realise I’ve eaten too much and my body diverts all its energy and resources to digestion, and my thinking goes fuzzy as my head feels lighter” then I’ve likened it to a physical body metaphor. If that metaphor is meaningful to me, it will be memorable. Taking this further, if I want to convey ideas in a way that others will remember them, then I should choose familiar and universal metaphors to liken them too. Marketers use this trick all the time to introduce new products and services without triggering consumer’s resistance to change and newness.  So in summary, maintain a map of your reading territory consisting of the topics of interest and all the books on your radar. Speed read or scan them, or use a book summary service, to prioritise your reading. Then selectively read deeply, and throw all the memory tricks here at the key books so that you can access the knowledge you need, when you need it.\nI would like to end on a simple idea that helps tremendously: be selective, and let go of guilt. Don’t treat reading books like a challenge that must be overcome. Reframe your reading as meeting different goals, and take pleasure and time to read the books that really matter. You will have less mental clutter, more time, and enjoy the process far more. Best of luck.\n",

    "content": "Actionable Items for Blogging  Course Material Reference Diagrams and Pics Others  What is Spring? Meet the Spring Family\nThe Spring family all began with the creation of the Spring Framework, which was built largely in response to the complexity of developing applications using Java’s enterprise framework called J2EE, it’s now called Java EE, and the Spring Framework aimed at removing the complexity and helped to make things like web development and data access easier for developers to implement. It also aimed at reducing boilerplate code, and if you’re not familiar with what that is, it’s repetitive code that’s often needed as part of the logic, but tends to clutter the application and draw focus away from the main logic. The Spring Framework is still heavily used today, and it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. The success of the Spring Framework led to the creation of several Spring projects that were built on top of the Spring Framework, but tailored to specific needs or domains. For example, the Spring Security project was created to remove the complexity and challenges with securing a Java application, and another project, like the Spring Data project, was created to further simplify data access in Java applications. The Spring Framework and Spring projects continued to evolve and thrive, eventually resulting in the creation of a particularly impactful project called Spring Boot. Spring Boot was a real game changer. It provided a new and drastically faster way of building Spring-based applications. Up until Spring Boot, building a Spring-based application had always involved a lot of choice making, configuration, and a cumbersome deployment model. Spring Boot removed all of that by taking an opinionated view of building Spring-based applications including sensible defaults for library choices and configuration, and adding smarts for auto-detecting and auto-configuring other common configurations. It also massively simplified the deployment process and made running a Spring-based application as simple as running a single command. Lastly came the Spring Cloud project. Spring Cloud was built on top of Spring Boot and simplified the development of applications that make use of distributed architectures, such as microservice architectures, and these type of architectures often have many common patterns that are implemented, such as service discovery and distributed configuration, and Spring Cloud helped to make it easier for developers to build applications that use those patterns. Now that we’ve been introduced to the Spring family, let’s take a look at why we would want to use it.\nWhy Spring?\nSo why Spring? And oftentimes you’ll hear people asking, why would I want to use Spring? And that’s probably something you may be even thinking for yourself right now. And one of the common answers you’ll hear is that it’s a good alternative to Java EE, and while that was true in the beginning, today Spring is so much more than just an alternative to Java EE. In fact, it’s actually complimentary to Java EE and makes use of several of the standard specifications like the Java Persistence API. The question of why you would want to use Spring is a completely valid and reasonable question that actually has a very simple answer, and that’s that creating software can be hard, seriously, and Spring helps make it easier. You’ll notice that regardless of the project within the Spring family, they all share a common theme, and that’s to make developing Java applications easier. Let’s talk about some other reasons why Spring is a good choice. First, Spring is really great at being flexible, modular, and especially backwards compatible. So Spring is far from an all‑or‑nothing type of choice. In fact, you’re given the freedom to pick and choose whichever parts of Spring make the most sense for your project. And what’s really great about that is that you can be sure that the investment you’re making with Spring won’t be wasted when a new version is released. Spring also has a very large and active community, and in my opinion this is often one of the things that’s overlooked and taken for granted when assessing technologies, but it makes a huge difference. With Spring, you can be sure that there’s a wealth of knowledge that already exists out there, and if you run into a problem, it’s likely that someone else has already ran into that same problem, and they can probably help you through it. And lastly, what makes Spring a good choice is that it’s continually innovating and evolving. Being an open‑source project but fully backed by a company called Pivotal allows Spring to remain healthy and alive, while at the same time pushing the bounds of enterprise Java development. It’s not uncommon for Java’s standards or specifications to be influenced or based on ideas that originated within Spring.\n",

    "content": "Why Python? Simple to Learn\nPython is very simple to learn. Very minimal computer knowledge is required to learn and use Python. You don’t need to know the difference between computer memory and a hard drive, you don’t need to know what an operating system is, you don’t need to know what a compiler is, nor do you need to know about build systems, and you don’t need to learn any other programming languages first. Whether you’re new to computers or not, you can learn Python. Python is also built with a goal to be easy to read and understand.\nSimple to Use\nThere are several core tenets of the Python programming language that makes it simple to use. One of the first tenants contributing to Python’s ease of use is that there is usually only one way to do things. Some programming languages believe strongly in flexibility, that the developers should be able to solve a given problem in many different ways. Python is not one of these languages. Being able to solve a single problem many ways is like having a large box of building blocks without any instruction book, or it can be like sitting in front of a blank canvas and being able to paint anything you want. At times, this feeling can be very freeing. When you are first using a programming language, though, constraints are very good to have. They provide guardrails that helped guide you to a likely solution. The constraints help point you in a direction that will help you maintain your forward momentum. This single way to accomplish a task also translates to Python’s next tenant. Python focuses on simplicity. That simplicity translates to ease of use. Excess complexity introduces confusion. Let’s say you were wanting to learn to use a new device. If there are lots of knobs to turn, levers to pull, and buttons to push, it can be difficult to figure out how to use that device, but with a simplified and intuitive interface, what needs to be done becomes clear and more obvious. That’s why a language that focuses on simplicity like Python is simple to use as well. Finally, Python and its community encourages beautiful code. The focus on beauty makes it a more pleasurable experience to use. When you don’t enjoy using something, it makes it more difficult to continue using that thing. If something brings you joy, though, it increases your desire to continue using it. The Python community has come to embrace this principle when building Python features. For these reasons, and more we’ll investigate in our next module, Python is a programming language that is simple to use.\nGreat Community\nA large contributing factor to Python being simple to learn and use is thanks to support from Python’s great community. The Python community has driven many core principles into Python, which has helped it become what it is today. The community involvement can be seen directly in how Python is supported and how Python is developed as a language. The community provides great support for developing Python code. You can see this in the countless third‑party Python packages and code libraries that are available, the great third‑party tools that can be used when using Python, and much more. We will take a closer look at these later in this course. Python’s development is also conducted largely through community‑driven proposals called Python Enhancement Proposals, also known as PEPs. This process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding proposals are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community. This has enabled Python to evolve as a shared language and evolved to user’s changing needs over the many years. Many of the principles we’ve already covered in this course were arrived at as part of this process.\nHigh Demand Python continues to grow in popularity, and the ability to work with Python is a skill that’s increasing in demand in the industry. In even the recent past, when many developers thought of popular programming languages, they tended to think of Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, and perhaps even PHP. Python didn’t usually come to mind. But according to some recent Stack Overflow analysis, Python has now overtaken other languages like Java, C#, and C++ based on Stack Overflow question views. And according to PYPL, the PopularitY of Programming Language Index, Python is now the most popular programming language, with its popularity continuing to grow each year. And it doesn’t stop there. Python has the highest spectrum rating according to the recent IEEE Spectrum report, and the TIOBE index now has Python in the top three of programming languages worldwide. All this to say, there’s really no longer any denying that Python is a popular programming language and a great language to invest your time into learning.\n Widely Used Over its many years of usage, Python has continued to grow and has become increasingly powerful and capable. Python has been used anywhere from special effects in movies like Star Wars to application scripting support in the popular open source, 3D modeling application, Blender. Four areas I’ll highlight where Python has seen widespread use are web development, data science, education and learning, and scripting. As we briefly discuss each, it’s okay if you don’t understand what each area is or how Python is used within it. With these examples, I’m just aiming to emphasize that Python is widely used in many different areas.\nWeb Development The first area we’ll discuss where Python has seen growing use is in the area of web development. There are many different buckets or styles of web development. You might be developing just an HTTP or REST API and, hence, not dealing with front‑end user interfaces, just back‑end service code. Or, you might be building a full‑stack web application that touches both the client and the server. You might even be working with an out‑of‑the‑box content management system application, ERP application or an application of a different flavor. No matter which it is, though, there’s a Python solution out there for you. If you’re building APIs, you can find existing popular Python frameworks like Flask, Bottle, Pyramid or a myriad of others. And the same goes with full‑stack web development. You have popular frameworks like Django, TurboGears, web2py, and many others at your disposal. And for the full, self‑contained web applications, you can find apps like Plone, django CMS, Mezzanine, and more. Basically, no matter what type of web application you’re developing, Python is being used out there today and can likely meet your needs too.\nData Science Data science is a field that is growing in popularity with each passing week. Data science itself is an exceptionally large field. Two common areas that tend to be wrapped up in the data science field are those of big data and machine learning. Let’s take a quick look at both of them. So what is big data? As developers, we’re used to thinking of data in terms of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, but data is growing rapidly. More and more systems are needing engineers to start thinking in the terms of terabytes, petabytes or, in some cases, even exabytes. Yes, exabytes. The amount of data being generated each day is growing rapidly and shows no signs of stopping. As of 2012, 2.4 EB of new data were generated every single day. To put that in perspective, that is 2.5, followed by 18 zeros. Datasets have grown so large that existing data processing systems are unable to deal with them. New systems are needed. This is where the growing popularity of technologies like Hadoop and MapReduce are coming from. What used to be a problem faced primarily by large companies like Google or Microsoft is now starting to be faced by smaller enterprise businesses. The more data we have available to us, the more we can spot new business trends, find correlations to help prevent new diseases, combat crime, and so on. And Python is a popular programming language used in this space. Now, machine learning is not directly related to big data; however, the more data we have available to us, the more powerful machine learning becomes. So what is machine learning? Today we are surrounded by data everywhere. It comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes. It might come from large text files, or it might be generated by the actions of users. It may be the large amount of metadata available in pictures and videos, or it might be networks and graphs of relationships people have with each other. The many relationships that might exist between all this data is potentially much more complex than any single person or group of people could find. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack. So instead, algorithms are written in such a way that a computer can process all the data and find its own connections between the many different sources. Machine learning is now commonly used in several different places. It can be used to help determine whether a given piece of email is spam or not, it can be used to help detect possible network intrusions by using the vast amount of network traffic to detect what is abnormal or not, it’s used for optical character recognition to convert images of text into text data that a computer can understand and process, or it can be used for computer vision problems like face detection, object tracking, and motion tracking, and new uses for machine learning are being discovered every day.\nEducation and Learning Python is widely used in education and learning, and its popularity continues to grow in the field. Python is getting wider adoption as a language to use when teaching basic STEM skills to younger students across the world. It’s also being used as a first programming language in which to teach people programming in the first place. This usage is not just for younger students either, as Python is becoming more popular as a language to teach programming in college courses around the world as well. Python is being used as an education tool to teach people more about computing hardware as well via accessible maker devices like the Raspberry Pi and the micro:bit. Another great way Python is used in education is via Jupyter Notebooks. Sometimes the best way to learn is through interaction and exploration of what code does and the consequences of changing a given piece of code. Jupyter Notebooks, a project that grew out of the interactive Python interpreter IPython are a great way to share different topics with people and to encourage people to explore a given topic in an interactive way that can be changed in code. Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity lately, especially in the data science space, and is pushing forward the concept of interactive education, especially in computer programming.\nScripting One of the most common uses of scripting with Python is to perform administration of computers When writing scripts to administer a machine, it’s routine to work with folders and files on the machine, perhaps managing a series of log files or examining and monitoring the file system. Or we might be dealing with the configuration of apps and services. We can monitor the processes running on a system, keeping an eye on any potential runaway processes that need to be kept in check. We may even deploy a new application, deploy new versions of an existing application or remove older applications that are no longer used. Python supports performing any of these tasks. The main limit is our imagination. We have full access to the wide variety of Python libraries that are already out there or that we are creating from scratch. The last area we’ll discuss is application scripting. One way to think of application scripting is to think about how we typically think of an application itself. As a user, we typically don’t think of an application as something that can be easily extended by us. The application is exactly what we’re given, no more, no less. But what if a user or developer could write their own code to respond to events that are raised within the application, or, going even further, what if a developer could write their own user interface elements, new screens, new user flows or something else and integrate it directly into the application itself? Not many applications written today take advantage of how powerful a concept this is. Games are one type of application that this is more common, but it’s less common to find this in your typical application outside of that area. But this is exactly what application scripting aims to do, and is one area Python can be used to a powerful degree. You can find it in 2D and 3D modeling software, image manipulation software in the form of different image processing algorithms, photo taking applications in the form of fun overlays over pictures, and other types of applications as well.\n",
