The basic idea is to always be training near or just below your limits. You always lift weights that are relatively heavy or run at a pace that is relatively challenging, by doing this, you avoid the injury and the damage and the frustration that could result in training beyond your limits. But you also avoid getting stuck in a rut by not pushing yourself enough. Most importantly, every time you progress, you immediately increase the level of intensity to maintain your progress.\nPomodoro technique Pomodoro technique, which is a method used to prevent fatigue and frustration. Basically, you’ll train for twenty to twenty five minutes and then take a five minute break and then train for another twenty to twenty five minutes and then take another five minute break after four pomodoro or twenty to twenty five minute periods, you’ll take a longer break, a 15 to 30 minutes. This method has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to maintain focus and creativity. So check it out\n",

I am able to recollect the entire course in \u003c 5 minutes. Thanks to Memory Palace and Jonathan Levi. I will always be greatful to you.\n Ramp - Fear and Our Brain’s Default Setting\nIf I had to pick the number one silent killer of our productivity and the biggest thing that holds people back from being as productive as they can possibly be, that would be your own brain and its desire to keep you safe.\nNow, all of us struggle with procrastination from time to time. In fact, in many cases, our procrastination is simply a symptom of fear, whether it be fear of failure, being concerned we won’t live up to expectations or produce good enough work, or even if it’s just a task that’s outside of our comfort zone, we’ll rationalize reason after reason.\nBut it’s not just physical harm that your brain is trying to protect you from. It’s also emotional harm.\nBut because our brain doesn’t distinguish the difference between physical or emotional harm, it wants to avoid both.\nCourage is not the absence of fear. It’s the willingness to act in spite of fear.\n Dance Fear - Forgetting Steps, Taking a lot of time to learn, Upset when girl says no.\n Practise and Make a Routine for different dance forms.\n   AWS Exam Fear - Device a System, that will help you learn and remember things. To begin with, memory palace and association looks great options.\n Let this be 1st thing that you want to do daily.\n   Canada Fear - There is nothing much you can do about it. Keep doing proper follow up and thats all for now.\n  Seating Arc - Overwhelm - How it holds you back and how you can beat it\nNow, here’s the thing. When your brain gets overwhelmed, it’s kind of like a breaker being shut off. Your brain just completely shuts down. Now, I hear this from my clients and my students all the time. They’re overwhelmed and they don’t even know where to start. And in many cases, when this happens, they freeze, it paralyzes them and they’re just stuck in the mud. But the problem is those tasks don’t go away. That only makes the problem worse. I do have some good news for you. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. You see, overwhelm really is subjective. It’s much more of an emotion that it is a reality. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way. Please don’t leave this lecture without really internalizing this fact. With the right system or structure in place, you can manage just about anything that comes your way.\nThe first thing you’ve got to do when you get overwhelmed is to get all those thoughts out of your head.\nAnd once you’ve got it on paper, you can then start to organize it and create a plan\n Soft Skill Courses - So many and which one to do !\n  Technical Course - So many and which one to do !\n  ToDo - Endless List, what to do what not to do !\n  Daily Activities - So many of them !\n  Soil/Earth - Failing To Plan.\nThe first thing that planning is going to do for you is provide clarity now, planning forces you to get clear on what it is you actually want to accomplish. It allows you to really decide how to invest your time and what your most important tasks are. Now, as silly as this sounds, many don’t even know. And it sounds simple, I know, but I can’t tell you how often when I sit down to write out the three most important tasks that I want to accomplish that day, how frequently I pause and have to really give it some serious thought. This is a really critical first step. Another key benefit of having a plan is the locks you in. And once you lock in to your priorities of the day, it’s really going to help you lock out all the distractions and all the things that pop up along the way. They can get you sidetracked. And lastly, a plan creates great subconscious accountability. When you’ve got a system and you’ve got a plan and you actually write out what your top priorities are for the day, I’m telling you, it will nag at you until you get it done. And I’ve found that this will at least double your chance of actually completing that task if you commit to it in writing. Please don’t underestimate the power behind this particular advantage, because be honest, we all love Crosson. Those things off our To-Do list. Now, if you don’t consistently plan your week and plan your day and you’re not doing that already, your job is to start planning your day and planning your week before the end of this course, I’m going to get into more depth and walk through this in more detail in future lectures. But like Benjamin Franklin said, failure to plan is planning to fail.\n Vehilce Mirror - Waiting for Things to Be Perfect\nOur next silent killer of productivity is waiting for things to be perfect, you see, unproductive people are great at waiting for the time to be right. They’re great at waiting until they feel like it, waiting until they’re in the mood to get started. The door of opportunity is right there for them to walk through it, but they’re waiting for it to open now. Rarely does the perfect time ever come. So let’s take a look at our rocket right here. Now, with the rocket such as this one, there’s something called escape velocity. Now, a rocket must reach a speed of about seven miles per second to escape the earth’s pull of gravity. But almost all of that energy is needed at the beginning when a rocket first launches. You and I are no different. But the good news is that objects in motion tend to stay in motion and all you need to do to get started is to get started and the rest will usually take care of itself.\n Tree - The Myth of Multi-Tasking\n Fence Wall - Time Leaks \u0026 Fake Breaks.\n I am sitting on the Fence Wall, and taking Fake Breaks\n Your brain and your body does need time to rejuvenate and needs breaks in order to perform this optimal level. But these types of activities, surfing the web, checking your email, looking at your Facebook page, these are fake breaks. They don’t actually reset your willpower, reset your focus or help you increase your energy. They’re actually making it worse now\n Fence Railing - Poor Emotional and Energy Managment / EE\n Speed Limit - Email - One of the biggest Silent Killers of Productivity\n Visitor Parking : L Shape - Time Managment V/s Self Management (Small L V/s Big L).\nAnd whether we like it or not, each minute is only made up 60 seconds and each week one hundred and sixty eight hours. And those are going to pass us by at the same speed no matter what we do. And in reality, when we’re talking about time management, what we really should be talking about is self-management, because the one and only thing that we have one hundred percent total control over is what we do and how we manage that time. Now, my suggestion is don’t wish you had more time. Instead, wish you had better self-management, better systems, better tactics, better habits, and probably most importantly, better execution on the stuff that you already know how to do and actually put it in a play which you already know you should be doing but aren’t doing. These are the things that really make a difference. And these are the things that you have. One hundred percent total control over time. If you don’t know how to manage yourself, if you don’t know how to set up and actually consistently use the right systems, it wouldn’t matter if you could make more time up here. You wouldn’t be able to fully take advantage of that extra time. So I’m going to encourage you right from the start to instill a new belief. And it’s not about time management. It’s about self management and making the most of the time that you already have. Because if you do make the most of that time that you already do have, you’re going to double and triple the results that you’re getting now.\n Overhead Park Fencing / Railing - Spending Time vs Investing Time\n A big clock hanging, and time is ticking.\n Now, one of the biggest mistakes, I think unhappy, broke and unsuccessful people make is in thinking short term versus long term when making decisions.\nAnd most people, myself included in the past, is typically focused on how they’re spending their time each day instead of focusing on how they’re investing their time\nAnd there’s a huge difference now when most people think of time management productivity, it’s in regards to getting the maximum number of things done in a day, a week or a year. But I’m going to encourage you to look at it from another perspective. When you invest in something, you hope that will give you a return that’s greater than what you invested. For example, if you put five dollars into a stock, you hope to get much more than that, five dollars over time. And I encourage you to look at time the exact same way. Spending your time is about getting things done, investing your time is about setting up systems and delegating tasks that will literally save you hours and create new hours in the future.\nNow, many people won’t take the time to train someone else to do that task or automate that task because it usually requires more effort in the short run.\nMany of the people that I speak with, a lot of them have trouble delegating and letting go. But once you understand the difference between spending your time and getting more time back in the future by investing your time, it becomes a real game changer.\nSo focus more on time investing activities that will pay you back each and every single day and are going to make you more and more productive.\n Speed Breaker - 1 (use only one speed breaker) - The Importance of Sleep to Your Productivity\nAccording to the University of Pennsylvania, if you get six hours of sleep per night for two weeks straight, which is a little less probably than you need, your mental and physical performance declines at the same level as if you stayed awake for 48 hours straight.\nAnother solution can be to take what I call a power nap. And most sleep research will suggest to keep it to less than 30 minutes to keep it from interfering with your normal sleep schedules and circadian rhythms. Even something as small as a 20 minute nap has been proven to improve your memory\n Gas Bank Door (use only one gas bank) - Water / The Healthiest Energy Drink That Most of Us Have Access to For Free!\nWhen your brain is fully hydrated, you think faster, you’re more focused, you have more creativity and more clarity. But most importantly, you’d be more productive. While your brain only makes up about three percent of your body mass, it actually uses up to 20 percent of the water and nutrients that you take in. And just like with sleep deprivation that we just got done talking about, even small amounts of dehydration can lead to big effects. Just one percent of dehydration can lead to a five percent cognitive decline\nIf you’re not sleep deprived and you don’t have as much energy as normal usually is because of dehydration. Start with water and nine times out of ten, that’s going to solve the problem. So I’m going to encourage you to drink water early, drink water often and stay hydrated. You’ll notice the difference and I promise you’ll thank me later\n Gas Bank Fire Extinguiser - Mastering Your Energy, Mood \u0026 Emotional State\nYou’ve got two choices. You can direct your attention to those things that are going well, things that are great in your life, things that are where you want them to be, and things that are within your control. And when you do that, how do you feel? You might feel a sense of gratitude, hope, appreciation and progress. But what if you instead choose to focus on what’s missing in your life, what’s going wrong, and focusing on all the things that maybe you’re going wrong in that are missing, that you can’t even control in that instance, how do you feel\nThe tough part is that most of our thoughts and behaviors are habits, the things that we do and thoughts that we think over and over again without even really giving it any conscious thought. So over time, you’ve developed automatic patterns and you habitually lean towards thinking one way or the other\nAnother major contributor to your mood is how you’re using your body at any given moment. As I mentioned in that earlier lecture, studies have shown that something as simple as how you use your body posture and have a hormonal effect specifically as it relates to testosterone and cortisol\nGas Bank Window - How Will Power Really Works\nI can sticker all over the window\nLover’s Point - Knowing and Doing Are Completely Different Things\nYes.\nBasketball Board - The Warren Buffet Productivity Secret\nBasketball Board Ring - The First and Most Technique\nStart your day with focused effort on your most important, highest value and highest impact activity. Now, here’s a way you might go about figuring out what that task is, and you can ask yourself what is the one thing that if you accomplished it today, would make your day a success and would make everything else that follows easier\nBasketball Board Pole Support - Your Productivity Secret Weapon\nThe biggest challenges with many of these tasks is that they lack a deadline\nBasketball Court Inner Circle - Using Parkinson’s Law to Your Advantage\nI highly encourage you to challenge yourself with aggressive deadlines, to really take your productivity to the next level\nBasketball Court Outer Circle - How to Use Daily Themes to Enhance Your Productivity\nHe gives each day of the week a theme so that he can assure that he’s not just putting out fires all day and working only on the urgent tasks, but he’s working on those things that will really have an impact on the results of both companies\nNow, this strategy helps you be intentional on what you’re focusing on, but also utilizes the power of batching activities. Batching is simply a type of time management strategy that groups similar tasks that require similar resources together in order to streamline their completion in the most efficient way possible. Now, bashing or using theme days minimizes distraction because it keeps your focus narrow. You’re only focused on one item or theme at a time. It also allows you to get into the flow much more easily and be efficient with your resources.\nHarvard Business Review, Peter Bregman notes that our productivity goes down by 40 percent when we try to focus on several things at once. In addition to batching, setting a theme to your day really allows you to make sure that you’re putting in enough time on the important high value activities that are really going to give you your best results.\nBasketball Court Center - Resurrecting Your Dead Time\nLately I am watching a lot of movies.

    "content": " SQ3R System  SQ3R System  During the survey step, which we also call pre-reading, we skim or scan the content before we read it to prepare our mind for the new information. This is thoroughly covered in the coming lectures.  Cut Page Project. A lot is covered in the project.   In the question phase, we ask ourselves questions to improve our motivation, such as why we’re trying to read and what’s in it for us. Clear motivation improves the reading process, and getting to the content from different perspectives improves our understanding.  I can start with YouTube Channel, which is pending since for ever. I can create videos for online courses. It can help me with creating Podcast It is blocking lot of other things (Creating course on Udemy, Book writing, YouTube channel etc.)   Next, we read. Either speed-reading, or in the normal fashion. When reading, you maximise the benefit of the previous S and Q steps, so you don’t have to reread, or dwell on irrelevant details. Then, we recall. We add details to the markers after reading each paragraph. This is our way to ensure we recall the paragraph. During our speed-reading training, we will have to read and recall a text several times until we get 100% retention. And only after several weeks will we really trust the brain to recall automatically. Finally, we review. We analyse the content from multiple perspectives, and we see what we learned and then we try to connect it to previous knowledge. The fastest readers, like Dr. Lev, will spend more time on this step than on all the previous steps taken together. That’s because if you do not review the article properly, it’s hard to understand it, and occasionally you will need to revisit it over and over. So, now that we understand the SQ3R Model, let’s learn how to optimise it starting out with surveying, or as we call it, pre-reading. Technique number one is to envision yourself using the material. As you read throughout the text, you should try to envision scenarios in which it could affect your life or how you could actually benefit from having that knowledge. How would you use the knowledge in your day-to-day life? Of course, as we mentioned before, try to connect any markers you develop to existing knowledge or experiences in your long-term memory. Technique number two , start asking questions. By developing your own questions and curiosities within the text, you’re going to see a huge improvement in both reading and comprehension. Perhaps for example, you see that the text mentions Baltimore, Maryland. Ask yourself, what the heck does Baltimore have to do with real estate law? What happened there? Was there maybe a precedent set? This trick alone is going to make you very motivated to read through the text and figure out, just what the heck is going on. Furthermore, you should find things that don’t seem to fit in and ask yourself, what they’re doing there. Technique number three , consider different perspectives. When I was struggling with pre-reading, Dr. Lev gave me a tip that has stuck with me to this day. He told me to ask myself questions involving perspectives, mine, the authors, even third parties. Though I’m not yet reading the text itself, I’m seeing the keywords and those keywords are enough to generate some pretty opinion laden questions. These include, what viewpoint do I anticipate the author taking? What viewpoint do I have going into reading this article? Where might the author be wrong? Where am I open to being persuaded on this topic? How could this material be improved? What would critics of this article likely say? Who are some people I know who might agree or disagree with what this article likely says? What would I expect to see in this text that I am not seeing at this speed?  ",

    "content": " What is Emotional Intelligence EQ V/s IQ The EQ Model Your Brain and EQ How to Improve EQ Mistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Identifying EQ Around You Common signs of low EQ. Examples of the high EQ Using EQ in Daily Life  Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5    What is Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize how your emotions are governing your decisions and your thinking. Once you know how emotions affect you, physically and mentally, you are able to learn how to change your reactions. This does not mean changing your emotions or hiding them. What is means is that, you want to identify your emotions and understand why you are feeling a certain way and be more aware of what to do differently and how to do things differently.\nSo bascially, EQ is about identifying how you feel and taking an opportunity to decide how your emotions are helping or hindering you in the work you do and the relationships you have.\nEQ V/s IQ A high IQ doesn’t predict success at work. EQ is a much more reliable indicator of success at work. Whereas People with high EQ are the majority of the top performers. They make better work decisions for themselves, their peers, and their companies. They are well situated to take on exciting opportunities within and outside of their organizations and they make more money than people with low EQ. Executives with high EQ are more likely to succeed than those with high IQ.\nThe EQ Model The concept of emotional intelligence can be broken down into four sections.\nSelf-awareness Your ability to be aware of your feelings in the moment, as they are developing. You feel them and you understand why they are there. It’s about getting to know yourself, listening to yourself, your body, your mind, and your heart. It’s about being self-aware. As your body physically reacts to people and situations, are you feeling the changes?\nSelf-management It involves managing your emotions and the resulting reactions. What you say and do. How well are you managing your emotions? Are you allowing them to drive what you say, think, and do? This isn’t about putting your emotions into a box and sealing it closed. It’s about actively overseeing your reactions.\nSocial awareness It is your ability to recognize and respond to the needs of others. Now some people at work express their needs openly such as I’m frustrated and I need help. Others may not be as explicit with their feelings. You may have to learn how to “read” those people and then to ask questions. People with high social awareness are observing and listening to people. They are empathetic.\nRelationship management It involves considering your emotions as well as those of others as you develop and master relationships. People skilled at Relationship Management build bonds with others. They value teamwork and collaboration, and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nYour Brain and EQ Evolution plays a trick on us humans in such situations because our brains are wired to process and react with big emotions before processing in a logical fashion. In other words you might react emotionally in tiny invisible ways or big bold ways before reacting logically.\nBut research has confirmed that your brain is flexible, malleable and changeable. You can decide to behave more logically rather then being emotionally hijacked. What this means to you is that you can change your behavior, and decide your response in trying and unpleasant circumstance.\nHow to Improve EQ The first and foremost way to increase your EQ you need to learn how to identify the emotions. It begins with understanding how you feel in the grip of emotions. Your body may feel the emotions before you actually “get it”\nLearn Why You Feel It: Once you begin to note how you feel, the second step in self-awareness is to connect the feeling with the reason or cause. Your body might show signs as a result of emotions, even before you realize what’s going on. When you are able to feel a physical sign of it, you will become better at understanding what is happening and why. The people, places, events, times of the day that create a certain emotional reaction. So you’re starting to read your body which is fabulous. Now you need to write down the situations that make you feel one way or another.\nWhat Are Your Buttons?: To change your EQ you need to start with information about the people, places, and times of the day, and so forth, that cause you to respond in ways that are ineffective or unproductive. What pushes your buttons? What provokes you, creates a strong emotional reaction? Is it a silent or covert reaction? You’re fuming on the inside but you’re smiling on the outside. Or, is it a loud one? Having an expression on your face that says it all. Once you identify and become self-aware of your buttons you can begin to manage them, as follows:\n Identify where in your body you are feeling stress, anxiety, excitement, and so forth. This is the “Feel It” part of the exercise. Next connect the dots by considering the situation you find yourself in when you get sweaty, your mouth is parched, you feel lightheaded, or so forth. This is the “Place It” part of the exercise. These situations are your buttons. Buttons that when they’re pushed, they bother you. Final step, think about and describe why you feel a certain way in a certain situation.  The above steps will help you to understand and manage your emotions, and use the emotions in constructive and productive manner.\nMistakes to Avoid in Your EQ Development  Becoming too cautious about showing your emotions. They assume that having high EQ means lowering emotional reactions or limiting feelings. That’s false. Remember you are a human, not a robot. Emotions can be managed, not bottled up. Worrying about offending people. EQ leads you to a deeper consideration of what you want to express, with your words, emotions, and actions. Don’t avoid giving solid thoughtful constructive feedback because you are cautious of hurting someone else’s feelings. EQ is the solution to everything. I wish this were the case, but it’s not. EQ isn’t the answer to all of your challenges at work. I’m sure you’re aware of some projects that require hard skills right now, more than soft skills. For example, EQ won’t help you grow your programming skills. So be sure to view your professional development as a balance of hard and soft skills. Failing to ask people to support you. Don’t keep your EQ progress a secret. Remember that emotional intelligence is the leading indicator of success at work. So why not share your interest and ask for support as you build it?  Using EQ to Manage Relationships. Relationship management is your understanding of your emotions and how you use that ability to manage interactions with others, in a manner that leads to success for both sides or parties. People skilled at relationship management build bonds with each other. They value teamwork and collaboration and they are able to handle conflict in productive and thoughtful ways.\nIdentifying EQ Around You Social awareness is your ability to observe what others are saying with their words, and with their bodies, and to examine how it affects you.\nSo the first part of strong social awareness involves watching and listening to others. The second part is learning more about the people you work with so you can better understand how to shift your approaches to partnering with them. You learn what people respond to and what they don’t. You learn what they like and what they appreciate and what they don’t enjoy. You don’t need to have a different or unique approach for every single person you work with. You need to start paying more attention to their signals. They are sending them all the time, all day long.\nCommon signs of low EQ.  Emotional outbursts. Sudden outbursts that are not a regular occurrence or a trend in this person’s behavior. Passive-aggressive behavior. Someone who is filled with frustration on the inside yet avoids confrontation or honest expression of feelings. Big Reactions. Allowing small things to cause big reactions. Someone who gets stressed easily and can blow some things out of proportion. Failing to ask how others feel. Even when other people show emotions in their faces, their bodies, and in non-verbals. Inability to read social cues from others. Doesn’t take the time to read or pay attention to some signals. Self-centeredness. It’s all about him or her, all the time. Lack of empathy. Someone who is unable to understand and share the emotions of others. Lack of emotion, avoids showing their feelings at any time, stoic. Lack of self-awareness. Someone who doesn’t know his or her buttons, has no idea what sets them off. Blaming others for his or her mistakes.  Examples of the high EQ  Asking questions for clarity when receiving criticism Listening, 100 percent. And listening, before speaking. The ability to apologize without being nudged to do so Showing passion, frustration, anxiety, the full range of emotions, yet in an appropriate manner. Learning. People with high EQ are looking for ways to improve, to learn. Sharing praise and criticism, openly and with details. Demonstrating empathy. Reading emotions and relating to them. Being assertive but not aggressive. Making mistakes and freely admitting it. Wow, that’s a huge sign of high EQ. Number ten. Valuing the goals of the team and the organization above his or her own.  Using EQ in Daily Life The best way to work on EQ is to actually start using it in Daily Life. In this section, I will capture how I have been using EQ in my life, and dealing with emotionally stressful, anxious and stressful situations.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Scenario 5 ",

Meet the Spring Family\nThe Spring family all began with the creation of the Spring Framework, which was built largely in response to the complexity of developing applications using Java’s enterprise framework called J2EE, it’s now called Java EE, and the Spring Framework aimed at removing the complexity and helped to make things like web development and data access easier for developers to implement. It also aimed at reducing boilerplate code, and if you’re not familiar with what that is, it’s repetitive code that’s often needed as part of the logic, but tends to clutter the application and draw focus away from the main logic. The Spring Framework is still heavily used today, and it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. The success of the Spring Framework led to the creation of several Spring projects that were built on top of the Spring Framework, but tailored to specific needs or domains. For example, the Spring Security project was created to remove the complexity and challenges with securing a Java application, and another project, like the Spring Data project, was created to further simplify data access in Java applications. The Spring Framework and Spring projects continued to evolve and thrive, eventually resulting in the creation of a particularly impactful project called Spring Boot. Spring Boot was a real game changer. It provided a new and drastically faster way of building Spring-based applications. Up until Spring Boot, building a Spring-based application had always involved a lot of choice making, configuration, and a cumbersome deployment model. Spring Boot removed all of that by taking an opinionated view of building Spring-based applications including sensible defaults for library choices and configuration, and adding smarts for auto-detecting and auto-configuring other common configurations. It also massively simplified the deployment process and made running a Spring-based application as simple as running a single command. Lastly came the Spring Cloud project. Spring Cloud was built on top of Spring Boot and simplified the development of applications that make use of distributed architectures, such as microservice architectures, and these type of architectures often have many common patterns that are implemented, such as service discovery and distributed configuration, and Spring Cloud helped to make it easier for developers to build applications that use those patterns. Now that we’ve been introduced to the Spring family, let’s take a look at why we would want to use it.\nWhy Spring?\nSo why Spring? And oftentimes you’ll hear people asking, why would I want to use Spring? And that’s probably something you may be even thinking for yourself right now. And one of the common answers you’ll hear is that it’s a good alternative to Java EE, and while that was true in the beginning, today Spring is so much more than just an alternative to Java EE. In fact, it’s actually complimentary to Java EE and makes use of several of the standard specifications like the Java Persistence API. The question of why you would want to use Spring is a completely valid and reasonable question that actually has a very simple answer, and that’s that creating software can be hard, seriously, and Spring helps make it easier. You’ll notice that regardless of the project within the Spring family, they all share a common theme, and that’s to make developing Java applications easier. Let’s talk about some other reasons why Spring is a good choice. First, Spring is really great at being flexible, modular, and especially backwards compatible. So Spring is far from an all‑or‑nothing type of choice. In fact, you’re given the freedom to pick and choose whichever parts of Spring make the most sense for your project. And what’s really great about that is that you can be sure that the investment you’re making with Spring won’t be wasted when a new version is released. Spring also has a very large and active community, and in my opinion this is often one of the things that’s overlooked and taken for granted when assessing technologies, but it makes a huge difference. With Spring, you can be sure that there’s a wealth of knowledge that already exists out there, and if you run into a problem, it’s likely that someone else has already ran into that same problem, and they can probably help you through it. And lastly, what makes Spring a good choice is that it’s continually innovating and evolving. Being an open‑source project but fully backed by a company called Pivotal allows Spring to remain healthy and alive, while at the same time pushing the bounds of enterprise Java development. It’s not uncommon for Java’s standards or specifications to be influenced or based on ideas that originated within Spring.\n",

    "content": "Why Python? Simple to Learn\nPython is very simple to learn. Very minimal computer knowledge is required to learn and use Python. You don’t need to know the difference between computer memory and a hard drive, you don’t need to know what an operating system is, you don’t need to know what a compiler is, nor do you need to know about build systems, and you don’t need to learn any other programming languages first. Whether you’re new to computers or not, you can learn Python. Python is also built with a goal to be easy to read and understand.\nSimple to Use\nThere are several core tenets of the Python programming language that makes it simple to use. One of the first tenants contributing to Python’s ease of use is that there is usually only one way to do things. Some programming languages believe strongly in flexibility, that the developers should be able to solve a given problem in many different ways. Python is not one of these languages. Being able to solve a single problem many ways is like having a large box of building blocks without any instruction book, or it can be like sitting in front of a blank canvas and being able to paint anything you want. At times, this feeling can be very freeing. When you are first using a programming language, though, constraints are very good to have. They provide guardrails that helped guide you to a likely solution. The constraints help point you in a direction that will help you maintain your forward momentum. This single way to accomplish a task also translates to Python’s next tenant. Python focuses on simplicity. That simplicity translates to ease of use. Excess complexity introduces confusion. Let’s say you were wanting to learn to use a new device. If there are lots of knobs to turn, levers to pull, and buttons to push, it can be difficult to figure out how to use that device, but with a simplified and intuitive interface, what needs to be done becomes clear and more obvious. That’s why a language that focuses on simplicity like Python is simple to use as well. Finally, Python and its community encourages beautiful code. The focus on beauty makes it a more pleasurable experience to use. When you don’t enjoy using something, it makes it more difficult to continue using that thing. If something brings you joy, though, it increases your desire to continue using it. The Python community has come to embrace this principle when building Python features. For these reasons, and more we’ll investigate in our next module, Python is a programming language that is simple to use.\nGreat Community\nA large contributing factor to Python being simple to learn and use is thanks to support from Python’s great community. The Python community has driven many core principles into Python, which has helped it become what it is today. The community involvement can be seen directly in how Python is supported and how Python is developed as a language. The community provides great support for developing Python code. You can see this in the countless third‑party Python packages and code libraries that are available, the great third‑party tools that can be used when using Python, and much more. We will take a closer look at these later in this course. Python’s development is also conducted largely through community‑driven proposals called Python Enhancement Proposals, also known as PEPs. This process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Python. Outstanding proposals are reviewed and commented upon by the Python community. This has enabled Python to evolve as a shared language and evolved to user’s changing needs over the many years. Many of the principles we’ve already covered in this course were arrived at as part of this process.\nHigh Demand Python continues to grow in popularity, and the ability to work with Python is a skill that’s increasing in demand in the industry. In even the recent past, when many developers thought of popular programming languages, they tended to think of Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, and perhaps even PHP. Python didn’t usually come to mind. But according to some recent Stack Overflow analysis, Python has now overtaken other languages like Java, C#, and C++ based on Stack Overflow question views. And according to PYPL, the PopularitY of Programming Language Index, Python is now the most popular programming language, with its popularity continuing to grow each year. And it doesn’t stop there. Python has the highest spectrum rating according to the recent IEEE Spectrum report, and the TIOBE index now has Python in the top three of programming languages worldwide. All this to say, there’s really no longer any denying that Python is a popular programming language and a great language to invest your time into learning.\n Widely Used Over its many years of usage, Python has continued to grow and has become increasingly powerful and capable. Python has been used anywhere from special effects in movies like Star Wars to application scripting support in the popular open source, 3D modeling application, Blender. Four areas I’ll highlight where Python has seen widespread use are web development, data science, education and learning, and scripting. As we briefly discuss each, it’s okay if you don’t understand what each area is or how Python is used within it. With these examples, I’m just aiming to emphasize that Python is widely used in many different areas.\nWeb Development The first area we’ll discuss where Python has seen growing use is in the area of web development. There are many different buckets or styles of web development. You might be developing just an HTTP or REST API and, hence, not dealing with front‑end user interfaces, just back‑end service code. Or, you might be building a full‑stack web application that touches both the client and the server. You might even be working with an out‑of‑the‑box content management system application, ERP application or an application of a different flavor. No matter which it is, though, there’s a Python solution out there for you. If you’re building APIs, you can find existing popular Python frameworks like Flask, Bottle, Pyramid or a myriad of others. And the same goes with full‑stack web development. You have popular frameworks like Django, TurboGears, web2py, and many others at your disposal. And for the full, self‑contained web applications, you can find apps like Plone, django CMS, Mezzanine, and more. Basically, no matter what type of web application you’re developing, Python is being used out there today and can likely meet your needs too.\nData Science Data science is a field that is growing in popularity with each passing week. Data science itself is an exceptionally large field. Two common areas that tend to be wrapped up in the data science field are those of big data and machine learning. Let’s take a quick look at both of them. So what is big data? As developers, we’re used to thinking of data in terms of kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, but data is growing rapidly. More and more systems are needing engineers to start thinking in the terms of terabytes, petabytes or, in some cases, even exabytes. Yes, exabytes. The amount of data being generated each day is growing rapidly and shows no signs of stopping. As of 2012, 2.4 EB of new data were generated every single day. To put that in perspective, that is 2.5, followed by 18 zeros. Datasets have grown so large that existing data processing systems are unable to deal with them. New systems are needed. This is where the growing popularity of technologies like Hadoop and MapReduce are coming from. What used to be a problem faced primarily by large companies like Google or Microsoft is now starting to be faced by smaller enterprise businesses. The more data we have available to us, the more we can spot new business trends, find correlations to help prevent new diseases, combat crime, and so on. And Python is a popular programming language used in this space. Now, machine learning is not directly related to big data; however, the more data we have available to us, the more powerful machine learning becomes. So what is machine learning? Today we are surrounded by data everywhere. It comes in all forms, shapes, and sizes. It might come from large text files, or it might be generated by the actions of users. It may be the large amount of metadata available in pictures and videos, or it might be networks and graphs of relationships people have with each other. The many relationships that might exist between all this data is potentially much more complex than any single person or group of people could find. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack. So instead, algorithms are written in such a way that a computer can process all the data and find its own connections between the many different sources. Machine learning is now commonly used in several different places. It can be used to help determine whether a given piece of email is spam or not, it can be used to help detect possible network intrusions by using the vast amount of network traffic to detect what is abnormal or not, it’s used for optical character recognition to convert images of text into text data that a computer can understand and process, or it can be used for computer vision problems like face detection, object tracking, and motion tracking, and new uses for machine learning are being discovered every day.\nEducation and Learning Python is widely used in education and learning, and its popularity continues to grow in the field. Python is getting wider adoption as a language to use when teaching basic STEM skills to younger students across the world. It’s also being used as a first programming language in which to teach people programming in the first place. This usage is not just for younger students either, as Python is becoming more popular as a language to teach programming in college courses around the world as well. Python is being used as an education tool to teach people more about computing hardware as well via accessible maker devices like the Raspberry Pi and the micro:bit. Another great way Python is used in education is via Jupyter Notebooks. Sometimes the best way to learn is through interaction and exploration of what code does and the consequences of changing a given piece of code. Jupyter Notebooks, a project that grew out of the interactive Python interpreter IPython are a great way to share different topics with people and to encourage people to explore a given topic in an interactive way that can be changed in code. Jupyter Notebooks have exploded in popularity lately, especially in the data science space, and is pushing forward the concept of interactive education, especially in computer programming.\nScripting One of the most common uses of scripting with Python is to perform administration of computers When writing scripts to administer a machine, it’s routine to work with folders and files on the machine, perhaps managing a series of log files or examining and monitoring the file system. Or we might be dealing with the configuration of apps and services. We can monitor the processes running on a system, keeping an eye on any potential runaway processes that need to be kept in check. We may even deploy a new application, deploy new versions of an existing application or remove older applications that are no longer used. Python supports performing any of these tasks. The main limit is our imagination. We have full access to the wide variety of Python libraries that are already out there or that we are creating from scratch. The last area we’ll discuss is application scripting. One way to think of application scripting is to think about how we typically think of an application itself. As a user, we typically don’t think of an application as something that can be easily extended by us. The application is exactly what we’re given, no more, no less. But what if a user or developer could write their own code to respond to events that are raised within the application, or, going even further, what if a developer could write their own user interface elements, new screens, new user flows or something else and integrate it directly into the application itself? Not many applications written today take advantage of how powerful a concept this is. Games are one type of application that this is more common, but it’s less common to find this in your typical application outside of that area. But this is exactly what application scripting aims to do, and is one area Python can be used to a powerful degree. You can find it in 2D and 3D modeling software, image manipulation software in the form of different image processing algorithms, photo taking applications in the form of fun overlays over pictures, and other types of applications as well.\n",
